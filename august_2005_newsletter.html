<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Let me start by thanking Keith and 
Audrey for their hospitality on the occasion of "Keith’s 60th Birthday Bash". 
Cool but dry weather helped towards making it a successful evening, as did the 
live music. Many of you are familiar with the white sports shirt that Alan has 
been trying to get rid of for a couple of years. He gift wrapped it for Keith 
but may well get it back again when his birthday comes around. Thanks from Keith 
for any Cancer Research donations, and desserts, cakes etc.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I mentioned last time that Len and 
Sally were going to try and book a breakfast for us at The Woodman, Nuthampsted 
(this side of Royston) on September 4th. Those of you going should already know 
the details. The cost is £7.50 per head and the meeting points are the normal 
ones at Bullsmoor Lane , Enfield &amp; Royal Forest Hotel, Chingford leaving at 
8 a.m.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The previous day several of us will 
be at Buntingford. Anyone who has not booked for this should ring the organiser, 
Leigh Wood (01763- 274743) to see if places are still available.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Although there has been some nice 
weather this summer, the Southend Run and Harpenden certainly didn’t have any 
luck with the sunshine.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">XK Day at Burghley House on 14th 
August was dry luckily. Like most clubs and Areas, the XK committee realise that 
there are rarely as many cars in attendance as there used to be, so sent flyers 
to other car clubs and it was nice to see some other cars (M.G’s, Mercedes, 
Austin Healey) amongst the Jaguars. As usual we had driven up on Friday 
afternoon to be ready for a drive around on Saturday morning. We had a few 
showers which settled into steady rain after we arrived at our hotel, the Ramada 
at Peterborough. This was very close to the River Nene and overlooked a 1,000 
metre competition rowing course. That weekend it was the venue for a big regatta 
and trailer loads of rowing boats started arriving that evening. Saturday 
morning was dry but overcast and rather than visit a farm centre which we had 
already seen before we went to the pretty little market town of Oundle. As we 
left there after lunch, the rain started and by the time we were due to visit 
Marshalls, the main Jaguar dealer at their new showroom it was pouring. We were 
made very welcome with tea and cake etc., and several people took the 
opportunity to have a sit in the new XK8.</FONT></P>
<P align=center></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually the sun came out just as 
we assembled for a Bucks Fizz in the evening and an hours boat trip along the 
Nene before dinner. This was very pleasant on a covered boat with a bar but it 
started raining a little bit on the way back. Just before we reached the little 
landing stage it stopped raining for a few seconds before the heavens opened 
just as we arrived. We then had to get back to the hotel, three or four minutes 
walk away, all dressed for dinner! A couple of the staff came to meet us and ran 
a shuttle service with big umbrellas and we were met with towels by more staff 
as we got in. The trip had been pleasant but its ending made it unforgettable!

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It was a very sad and depleted 
convoy (Len, Sally, Richard and ourselves) who set off from Hertford on a wet, 
miserable and cold Wednesday afternoon. Surprisingly there were also hundreds of 
other people just as mad as we were! The cars covered the two commons but we 
estimated the show was only half its normal size.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Erics gazebo was jam packed with 
people, wine and food!! Sadly we had to attempt to eat our picnic in the E-type! 
The chicken Caesar salad I had planned became plain chicken filled rolls - but 
we did manage to open some wine as well. Quite a balancing act in a two seater! 
We ambled in the rain to our usual chip shop and enjoyed the freshly cooked 
chips on the walk back to the show. </FONT></P>

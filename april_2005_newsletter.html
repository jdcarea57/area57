<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">By the time you read this we will 
have had our first Breakfast Run of the season, hopefully in good weather. A 
couple of years ago, it was even good enough to have a BBQ in Alan and Barbara’s 
garden afterwards!

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Have you started thinking about 
Christmas yet? If not, now is the time as we have just booked the Club Christmas 
Dinner. As mentioned in last month’s Newsletter, we are having a change of venue 
again; this time at the Pearse House Hotel, which is where Alan works. He has 
booked for December 3rd. Hopefully by being early in the month, it will cause 
less of a clash of dates, although it is never possible to suit everyone. At 
this event, It would be nice to see some of our members who have been with us 
for many years, but who we rarely see.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Enfield Pageant will be with us 
soon so make sure you notify Eric which day or days you can have your car on 
show.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A group of us are returning to the 
Corse Lawn House Hotel, near Tewkesbury on 9th and 10th September. If anyone 
wishes me to check availability, give me a ring.

(Whitewebbs Museum) - Friday 1st<FONT size=2> April – Sunday 3rd April 
2005</FONT></U></FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Report by Audrey &amp; Keith 
Williams</FONT></I></B></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We met up with Eileen &amp; Dick at 
‘The Bush’ in, a nice little place called, Ovington for a pub lunch about 
one-ish – too late for Dick to try his April Fool’s joke on us! It was sunny 
&amp; warm for a change so we took the opportunity of eating outside in a pretty 
woodland setting. We managed to proceed to our hotel in Brockenhurst without 
Dick doing his apparent usual detour via Southampton! Once again the Museum 
members made us very welcome and we had enough time to walk into the village for 
afternoon tea.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Saturday again was warm &amp; sunny 
and we visited Sammy Miller’s motorcycle museum in the morning &amp; Beaulieu in 
the afternoon. They had allocated the arena for our parking – so our collection 
of about 22 classic cars became one of the attractions!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Saturday evening was something of a 
gala night with free wine on the tables, a fancy hat competition, live music 
&amp; dancing and a free raffle. The theme of the hat contest was a film/song or 
a book. There were some wonderful creations. It kept us amused most of the 
evening trying to guess the titles. We thought it may be great entertainment 
value to do something similar for our Club at an event, like the Christmas meal? 
There might even be enough pennies in the funds to buy some prizes!!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">More sunshine on Sunday for our 
visit to Bucklers Hard Maritime museum. The car park became a source of interest 
to visitors when another car rally arrived.- the Carpenter’s Arms car club from 
Harpenden. (what a small world!) We recognised some of their members so had a 
quick chat about the next display on the Common in July.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We all stopped off about half way 
home for a Carvery lunch at ‘The Windmill’ in Alton. After the usual prize 
giving and speeches we headed home, still in glorious sunshine. A wonderful 
weekend again, made by the good weather and such great value for money. There’s 
still an open invitation to all our members to take part in EVVVS’ next rally in 
September, where I believe East Anglia was mentioned as a possible destination.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000><STRONG>Greetings from 
Austin, Texas in the United States!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#000000><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I just posted a 
message in your guest book on the Area 57 website. I used to be a member of your 
club way back in the early 80s. I was really pleased to find your website and to 
see Ron Risk's smiling face! he hasn't changed a bit!<BR><BR>Actually, Ron has a 
lot to answer for as it was he who got me interested in restoring E-Types 
(almost 25 years ago) when he helped me with my first E-Type restoration. He 
obviously created a monster because I now own a company in the US that 
specialises in E-Type restoration and performance and reliability upgrades for 
E-Types. I think we currently have 18 or 19 E-Types under restoration, as well 
as a bunch of other stuff.<BR><BR>Anyway, please pass on my very best regards to 
Ron Risk and anyone else who might remember my wife and I. I should have paid 
more attention when he used to tell me that he was sick of working on E-Types 
and he dreamed of being a milkman with no stress! I now know exactly what he 
meant!<BR><BR>Best Regards,<BR><BR>Dan &amp; Justine Mooney<BR><BR>Dan Mooney -

COLLINS</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>As most of you know, I have nothing to do with the 
finances of the Club. Barbara keeps a close eye on everything, the same as at 
home, but this time she made me look at the cheques received for our annual 
subscription before she banked them. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>The reason for this was because there were so many 
names that we couldn’t actually put faces to, as well as lots of names of 
friends that we haven’t seen for quite a while.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>I would, therefore, just like to say a sincere 
"thank you" to all our friends, past and present, that have supported our Area 
of the Jaguar Drivers’ Club for so many years.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>In fact, next year we celebrate the 20th 
anniversary of Area 57. Nearer to the time, we hope to plan a celebration party, 
similar to the one we held ten years ago at the Whitewebbs Museum of 
Transport.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P><FONT size=3>
<P align=justify>At this time it would be great for everyone to get together 
again and to renew friendships, and make welcome people normally unable to come 
to meetings.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

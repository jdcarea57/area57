<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">There have been various discussions 
lately with regard to the fact that we don’t go to as many car events en masse 
as we used to in the earlier days of Area 57. The reasons for this involve 
several factors, and I believe it has to do with the way people’s lives and 
interests change over the years. To a certain extent the classic car scene has 
changed; with a few exceptions car shows in general, as well as Jaguar ones, do 
not attract the numbers that they once did. Many of the JDC events return to the 
same venues year after year and, much as we are all enthusiastic about the 
marque, there are only so many times that you want to see row after row of 
Jaguars. In the past, one of the most popular shows (which on occasion had about 
fifteen of our cars all arriving together) was the Police Show at Chigwell. This 
really was a show that had something for everyone, but sadly it too has declined 
in the past few years and it is two or three years since we attended as a club. 
As I said earlier, people’s interests do change and whereas at one time, many of 
us were quite happy to go to an event every Sunday, not many are now able to do 
so, whether by choice or circumstances.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">If you know of a show that from past 
experience is worth attending, or a place of interest that would be worth 
organising a visit to, please let Alan or myself know well in advance. This can 
then be discussed at a meeting as well as being reported in the newsletter, and 
meeting places etc. can be organised. Not long ago we raised the possibility of 
a visit to the Shuttleworth Collection, but there wasn’t enough interest to 
follow it up. It did at least, however, get discussed rather than just appearing 
as a mention in the Newsletter. In addition, people inevitably have holiday or 
other commitments which can also rule out the type of mass attendance that used 
to occur in the past.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Having said all that, the Area 
remains a very strong social group. This is borne out by the success of the 
Breakfast Runs, Christmas Dinners, barbecues etc. Outings such as the visit to 
the De Havilland Museum, Standon Museum and the trip on the "Waverly" are all 
indications of the strength of the club in ways other than going to car shows, 
(although the excellent attendance each year at the Enfield Pageant of Motoring 
would certainly be the envy of many other clubs).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It is worth noting that the Area 
will reach its twentieth anniversary next March. We are the only UK JDC Area 
that holds twice monthly meetings, and we are still one of only four JDC Areas 
which operates its own web site. These, along with the production &amp; 
distribution of the monthly newsletter, would hardly seem to be the mark of a 
club in decline.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Last month, I should have mentioned 
a show at Althorne, near Burnham on Crouch. It is in aid of the Little Haven 
Children’s Hospice. The £40 that the sale of the floral pots that the Clockhouse 
Nursery donated for our Pageant Stand is to be given to this charity. The centre 
that Martin Rogers attends is to close, so we were not able to give the money to 
Dick and Eileen as usual. This show takes place on Sunday, 21st August and Dick 
may be able to tell you more about it as I don’t have a leaflet. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Hopefully we haven’t left it too 
late to squeeze in an extra Breakfast Run and Len and Sally are making enquiries 
at the Woodman, Nuthampstead, near Royston. We have been told that the landlord 
will accommodate a breakfast group, so it remains to be seen whether anything 
can be fixed for September 4th. Deciding on this date was a typical example of 
how difficult it can be to sort out a date to suit the majority of people. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Doug and I were chatting at 
Hoddesdon to a couple from the M.G. Club that meet every Monday at the Botany 
Bay Cricket Club, just off the Enfield Ridgeway. They said we would be welcome 
anytime, so maybe it might be worth thinking about meeting at the Legion as 
usual, one Monday, and then driving up to visit them in convoy. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We had about ten cars at the 
Hoddesdon Show on 9th July, but unfortunately no sunshine until just before we 
left to enjoy tea and cakes with Audrey and Keith. The show does attract a wide 
variety of cars, although again, numbers as a whole seem to be lower than they 
used to be.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">At some point in the proceedings we 
returned to our car to find a FOR SALE sign saying it had plastic body, Cortina 
parts, Morris Minor engine etc. Price £800 and a phone number. Correctly 
assuming Eric to be to blame we put it on his XK with the additional line 
"Insanity forces sale". Throughout the day we were all amazed at how many people 
kept tapping the body and some people were even seen ringing the phone number! 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I believe several cars went along to 
The Hollybush for Dick’s SS meeting recently and had a pleasant evening, and the 
Ace Cafe Classic Car Evenings on the 2nd Tuesday of every month are now 
attracting a few regulars. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Just a reminder about Keith’s 60th 
Birthday Bash (now with live music) on 6th August. I’m going to quote from an 
invitation Doug and I received recently; "Your presence not your presents" is 
what Keith wants.

<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Although we had had 
very good weather, this particular Sunday was overcast, the sun not appearing 
till 1pm.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">There was a good mix of cars but 
unsurprisingly, it being the 30th anniversary, a lot of XJSs, some really nice 
cabriolets among them. Several E-types were in attendance including Len &amp; 
Sallys V12. In the concours, the bronze class was won by a very smart XJ40 in 
solent blue, but just to show what the competion was like, in third place was a 
one owner, 20,000 mile red XJS which looked a winner to me but in fact scored 
only 647 points out of a 1000! I had to leave at 3pm, (working again), so I did 
not hear the other results.</FONT></P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P align=justify>Entry was £15 per car, but that did include a visit to the 
Shuttleworth collection, a museum of aircraft from both world wars plus some old 
cars and carriages. The XJ register were selling hats, t-shirts, badges etc., 
but there was only one stall selling spares, a little disappointing, but overall 
not a bad day.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#000000><FONT

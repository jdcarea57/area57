impossible for the weather on August Bank Holiday Monday to be worse than it was 
last year. As it turned out, it wasn&#8217;t as hot as we&#8217;d had before, or since, but 
pleasant enough for a lazy day. Anybody looking for a big car show would 
probably have gone to Knebworth but for a relaxing day that includes cars, 
steam, vintage tractors and heavy horses this show, now in it&#8217;s third year, 
can&#8217;t be beaten. The small fairground included dodgems which act like a magnet 
to Area 57. I think we had about ten cars for three rides. The last one 
definitely seemed shorter, so maybe they were trying to tell us something! On 
our way out, Doug and I met Dave Norton of the EDVVS, who expressed his 
gratitude for the way in which the Area supports Museum events.

WEEKEND 12th -14th September</FONT></DIV>

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I could take credit for the 
perfect weather that we enjoyed for the complete weekend; hardly a cloud in the 
sky.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A mini convoy left London, 
consisting of our E-type, Dick Rogers' and Eric Tetsell&#8217;s XK150s and Dick&#8217;s 
Daimler Double 6 which Keith Oswick had borrowed due to a problem with his 
Daimler 250. I had circled a few places on my map which were possibilities for 
lunch after browsing through an AA pub guide. As time went on, two were looking 
likely and we finally settled on the first of these. We drove into the car park 
to find two E-types already there and Len &amp; Sally Smerald and Keith &amp; 
Audrey Williams tucking into lunch. They had chosen it from another book and we 
had no idea they would be there. We headed off a little later than they did and 
were quite surprised to find them join on our tail not far from the hotel. 
Having taken a more main road than us, they had got caught up in the aftermath 
of an accident. Phil and Heather Kendon had got to the hotel a short while 
before us and it wasn&#8217;t long before we were sitting on a lovely terrace enjoying 
tea.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On Saturday morning we visited 
Snowshill Manor in the northern part of the Cotswolds. This houses a collection 
of thousands of items including model Samurai warriors, clocks, musical 
instruments, bikes, prams, spinning wheels, dolls houses and goodness knows what 
else. A visit to a nearby steam railway was abandoned in favour of a lazy 
afternoon back at the hotel. Phil and Heather left shortly after breakfast the 
next morning as they were going on to their daughter&#8217;s at Bristol. The rest of 
us drove to the lovely village of Bilbury which, like so many of the Cotswold 
villages, is a photographer&#8217;s dream. We then carried on to Burford for lunch and 
a wander up and down the main street before saying our goodbyes. We were all 
very impressed with the Cricklade Hotel; the service and food were excellent. 
Nothing was too much trouble and they were quite happy to find us a room to 
ourselves for coffee, while we attempted Keith and Audrey&#8217;s quiz. This proved to 
be a bit easier than the one Dick and Eileen set us on Friday evening which had 
us all racking our brains.

QUIZ NIGHT - Saturday 6th September</U></B></FONT></P>

Williams</I></B></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I joined our group at lunchtime and 
was surprised to see how little space had been allocated for us. The parking was 
very tight and there was no room to "set up camp" with our usual tables and 
chairs. It really was standing room only!!! - but overall a very good show. Alan 
Colllins estimated there were 158+ cars, to say nothing of a large amount of 
motorcycles. There was a wide variety of vehicles, ranging from a modern 
Williams Renault Spyder to an early 30&#8217;s Austin Cambridge. The car voted as Best 
in Show by exhibitors was a &#8216;concours&#8217; Jensen Interceptor (which has been seen 
at many other shows).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Buntingford is a pretty town - quite 
olde worlde. Bargain of the day was the home made cakes served with tea or 
coffee at St. John&#8217;s Church - all for £1. Everyone in our club became quite 
frustrated with the showers as they had to leather the cars down 3 or 4 times 
during the day!!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Most of us met up again during the 
evening to support the Quiz Night at Martin Rogers&#8217; School. Eileen and her 
colleagues had spent a lot of time and effort organising the evening. We all 
found the TV theme tune round quite difficult!! Fish and chips plus soft drinks 
were included in the £5 admission fee (they could have easily doubled the 
price). Eileen had made huge strawberry and raspberry pavlovas as an extra. Our 
club did very well on the raffle. Most of us won a prize!! We all felt the Quiz 
Night was wonderful value for money. Let&#8217;s hope with the raffle the proceeds 
will have boosted school funds for a few extras.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you Eileen for your hard work. 
(I gather about £200 profit was made.)

in cars before air conditioning? This month&#8217;s weather (August)</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">has underlined why it has become the 
modern must-have in-car feature.. unless you have a mosquito bite.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">One man got frostbite recently when 
he deliberately put his bare foot by the cold air vent in his Jaguar to ease the 
pain from his insect bite. Cue cheap gags about Jags being the coolest cars on 
the road.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Builder Steve Whitehouse sold his 
wife&#8217;s £50,000 Jaguar XK8 to buy a Second World War tank. Mr Whitehouse, 37, saw 
the £33,000 American M24 Chaffee tank at a military show in Belgium. He said 
yesterday: "I made the deal there and then. I was fretting all the way home 
about how to tell the wife - I&#8217;d already shaken hands on the deal."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Mr Whitehouse, of Frome Somerset, 
will register the 1944 tank so he can drive it on roads but will mainly use it 
at shows. Wife Dawn, 27, said of her XK8: "It was the car of my dreams. We saved 
up for ages to buy it and I was very upset. But we have a baby girl now, Mia, so 
it would not have been practical."

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>First and foremost, a few 
reminders again about the Enfield Pageant. Please be on site by 9 a.m., or 
contact someone if you may be held up. It takes time and patience to arrange the 
cars to their best advantage so try to be available when needed or leave your 
keys with another club member so that your car can be moved. All the essentials 
will be brought by the usual people. As usual club funds will provide bacon 
rolls, tea and coffee but do remember to bring a mug.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT 
face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As our site is always near the main walkway to the 
arena, Eric has agreed to the request from the EDVVS that some people will help 
with stewarding when the traction engines make their way along for their parade.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The weather wasn&#8217;t as kind as 
it has been in previous years for the charity event at Stanborough Lakes in aid 
of the East Herts Breast Unit Appeal. It was inevitable that the number of cars 
and visitors would be lower but hopefully a significant amount of money was 
still raised.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>XK Weekend - May 
10th/11th/12th</FONT></P>
<P align=center></B></U></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>This year Brian and Mary 
Davis had chosen Dartmoor as the setting for their Spring Weekend. We were based 
at a very nice hotel near Yelverton, on the edge of Dartmoor, about halfway 
between Plymouth and Tavistock. Everyone arrives in their own time on Friday and 
greetings are exchanged with familiar faces who are regulars on these weekends. 
As usual Dick, Eileen, Eric and Margot and ourselves travelled down together, 
arriving in lovely sunshine. Two places were arranged for us to visit on 
Saturday, the first being Morwellham Quay which is the highest navigable point 
of the River Tamar. Copper and later arsenic ore were both mined in large 
quantities in the area. Over the years deposits ran out and by 1970 the place 
was derelict. Today the area has been redeveloped and is an ongoing restoration 
project to show life as it was in the 19th century. There is a trip into the 
copper mine on a small train, sometimes in complete darkness. Our time was 
fairly limited but there is plenty to see there.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It had been arranged for us 
to visit Castle Drogo in the afternoon which was designed and built in the early 
20th century by Edwin Lutyens for a Mr Drewe who was the founder of the Home and 
Colonial grocery stores. (Not many of you will remember them!). We drove across 
Dartmoor to get there and of course, what had started as a lovely day developed 
into a downpour! Castle Drogo is up a long steep lane and apparently at 1000ft 
it&#8217;s garden is the highest owned by the National Trust. I don&#8217;t think anyone 
could say it is an attractive building. It was then back to the hotel to get 
ready for dinner, which like all the meals we had, was very good.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Sunday morning took us to the 
outskirts of Plymouth to visit Crownhill Fort which is a series of massive earth 
ramparts, hidden gun emplacements and tunnels built in the 1860s as a defence 
against attack from the French. We had a guided tour which left us wondering how 
long it took the soldiers based there to learn their way around all the 
tunnels.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>After Sunday lunch most 
people were on their way home, but along with about a dozen others, we had 
decided to stay one more night, so we had an afternoon free to do what we chose. 
Being so close we decided we would like to see the sea and Plymouth so rather 
than take the old cars into the heart of an unfamiliar busy town we asked 
reception to book a couple of cabs for us, which we then phoned when we were 
ready to go back to the hotel. It was definitely the best way of doing 
it.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Monday morning we woke to 
rain and the forecast of rain all day, so the journey home wasn&#8217;t pleasant, to 
say the least. The weekend though had gone as smoothly as Brian and Mary&#8217;s 
weekends always do, and was very enjoyable.

<P align=center></B></U></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>My wife Candy had a teaching 
inspection coming up so I persuaded Raj from work to be my navigator on the 
Haynes Spring Classic rally. We left Muswell Hill at 7.00 am and made good time 
to Prescott Hill climb (just North of Cheltenham) where the rally started: 151 
cars ranging in age from a 1948 Allard to a 2001 Porshe 911 Carerra. Amongst the 
assembled cars was a tasty variety of XK 150s and E types, plenty of Morgans and 
three Ferraris (a Mondial, a 308 GTS and a 348.) Oh dear we could be seriously 
slow in comparison!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It was the first opening of 
Prescott since winter and the start was a little late: proceedings were then 
held up even more when a couple of over enthusiastic early drivers ran out of 
road and had to be pulled out of gravel traps. We had a good first run at the 
hill and put in (for us) a quick time of only just over the magic 60 seconds, 
but our second run had to be aborted when we were red flagged: a rather 
competative looking Ford Escort rally car running just ahead of us had broken a 
half shaft on Pardon hairpin.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We then followed the tulip 
notes for a pleasant 33 mile run to Lord Bathurst&#8217;s Cirencester Park Rally 
stage. This was a bit of a disappointment as speeds were restricted to 30 mph, 
but as the route was full of potholes we probably wouldn&#8217;t have chosen to drive 
much faster anyway.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Then more tulip notes for a 
23 mile run to Castle Combe Circuit where we were allowed 9 laps. We were having 
good fun and progressing quite fast without too many other drivers overtaking 
us, but I guess I didn&#8217;t fully appreciate how much work my uprated Coopercraft 
brakes were doing and on lap 5 as I came over Avon Rise to Quarry Corner at 80 
to 90 mph my brake pedal went down to the floor. Not a nice feeling! A few quick 
pumps of the pedal and we did manage to slow down ok: then a very leisurely 
return to the pits to let my heart slow down. The problem was boiling brake 
fluid and slugs of brake fluid vapour in the lines. The remedy was a long lunch 
break whilst we let everything cool down, and then a quick bleed of the brakes 
with the help of the attendant RAC service. I guess the moral is to use 
competition brake fluid if you want do any circuit driving!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We then had a short run to 
Colerne airfield where the fast boys could make full use of the smooth long 
straight which must be almost a mile in length. For the first time ever (at 
least during my ownership) the Daimler topped the ton but we were still cautious 
about a potential repeat of the brake problem so didn&#8217;t try any heroics (unlike 
the Volvo Amazon behind which seemed to spend most of the time travelling 
sideways.) </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The last road stage was the 
40 mile run down to the Haynes museum in Sparkford where we finished with some 
driving skill tests before having a cream tea and a good look around the museum. 
If you haven&#8217;t been then it&#8217;s well worth a visit and there were quite a few new 
exhibits since my last visit.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I would love to tell you that 
we won one of the best driver awards, but alas I can&#8217;t. Still, it was a 
thoroughly good day and the Daimler ran like clockwork. With the journey home we 
covered 383 miles in the day at an average of 21.2 mpg, the latter despite some 
very lead soled right foot driving.

April</FONT></P>
<P align=center></B></U><B><I></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Report by Mick &amp; Jacquie 
Stubbings</FONT></P>
<P align=center></B></I></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The weather was extremely 
kind, the sun shone all day, which made the treasure hunt all that more 
enjoyable.We met John and Loraine at Phil and Angie&#8217;s. From Cheshunt we 
travelled to Tring where we met up with all the others who were taking part and 
in true Jaguar fashion we started with a very large breakfast, (still it had to 
last us until dinner). </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Breakfast over we received 
our clue sheets and were given our starting times, the time then was about 
11:30. It was planned so that we had a stop off time halfway round, this allowed 
our cars to rest and us to take on more refreshments and stretch our 
legs.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>In the instructions for the 
second half there was a note that said ignore the sign saying road unsuitable 
for cars, a few pot-holes, but all right to use, by the time we got to this part 
we were right behind John and Loraine, John read the sign stopped re-checked 
then proceeded, I did the same, but 50 yards on we realised we had made a 
mistake, TOO LATE! We stopped and as luck would have it another car not in the 
treasure hunt was behind us, so the girls went back and asked them. They said 
yes we had gone wrong, in fact we were in a dry river bed that 2 weeks before 
would have completely covered our car in water. The only way out was to continue 
straight on and about 1-2 miles further on we would be able to drive out, so on 
we went, but twice we encountered water which we had to get as far up the river 
bank as possible, as I was following John I held back waiting to see how deep 
the water was, just in case. When we managed to get out of the river we could 
not pick up the trail for the rest of the clues, so knowing where the pub was, 
that we were finishing at, we decided to head straight there, most of you will 
also know it, The Feathers at Wadesmill. Here we enjoyed a lovely carvery and I 
was asked how long had I owned an E-type off-roader.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A £500,000 appeal for a 
breast cancer unit is on its final lap after a vintage show of classic and 
bygone cars set the charity's totaliser racing. Cuffley resident Vicki Adkins, 
chairman of the East and North Herts Breast Unit Appeal, has the target in her 
sights after a successful vintage and classic car show in aid of the good cause 
at Stanborough Lakes in Welwyn Garden City on bank holiday Monday. Gleaming 
machines and finely-tuned engines, provided with the help of Enfield Motor 
Museum, formed the hub of a day of activities. Stalls, jugglers and a brass band 
made sure even non-drivers had plenty to admire. The fun day was coupled with an 
enjoyable evening at Brocket Hall, near Welwyn Garden City. Vicki's appeal to 
build a dedicated breast cancer unit now stands at £460,000, just £40,000 short 
of its target.

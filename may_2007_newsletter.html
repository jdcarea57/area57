<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Enfield Pageant is our 
next event at the Spring Bank Holiday weekend, and hopefully it will take place 
without all of last year's trials and tribulations due to the weather. Our 
thanks to Eric for his pre-show work in organising the passes. Please remember 
to be on site BY NO LATER THAN 9 a.m., and to bring any items you are 
responsible for.

</FONT></DIV>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The next event that has been 
mentioned is the Luton Festival of Transport, an event that Eric regularly 
attends. As I mentioned last month it attracted 1100 vehicles last year. Entry 
is £3 on the day, but if anyone is definitely going, Eric recommends 
pre-booking, which is free for driver and passenger and makes it a lot quicker 
to get in to the show. The phone contact number is 01582-597375 or E-mail

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Last year several of us went 
to a very wet National Day and probably weren't too keen on going to another 
one. However as this year's XK Day is to be on the same day at Stanford Hall in 
Leicestershire on July 29th, we will be going as it is always the last day of an 
XK weekend. Unfortunately it clashes with a Historic Race meeting at 
Silverstone. As the hotel that the XK Register and JDC in general are using is 
not too far away from Silverstone we hope to go there on the Saturday and get 
back to the hotel in time for the dinner. Pre -booked tickets for Silverstone 
are £20 but I'm not sure of on the day prices.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I will check out up to date 
details for the Kimbolton show to include next time.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The possibility of a Sunday 
lunch was mentioned and the Woodman seemed to be a more popular choice than the 
Crown at Shillington. The Information that Barb has been given by the Woodman is 
that they would do a two-course lunch for £11.95 and three course for £14.50. 
The date for this is Sunday 5th August and Barbara will need names of those 
wishing to attend.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Keith Oswick found out a lot 
of information for us about boat trips. The most popular one seemed to be a 
three hour cream tea cruise from Pitstone Wharf not very far from Tring. The 
cost is £14.95 adults &amp; £13.85 for seniors. We haven't set a date for this 
yet but the trips are available from June 3rd to Sept 30th and as they start at 
1.30pm there would be plenty of time for people to get there.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I should have mentioned last 
month that some of us are going to The Cricklade Hotel near Swindon on the 
weekend beginning Friday 7th Sept. If anyone would like me to find out if there 
are still any vacancies, please let me know.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><STRONG><U>XJ SPRING 
WEEKEND</U></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the end of April, Alan and 
Barb joined us on the XK Spring weekend to the relatively little known area of 
Cheshire. Luckily the weather that had been so good for all of April carried on 
and it was sunshine the whole time. We had a good journey apart from looking for 
a pub which I eventually found was the right village but wrong road. We also had 
an unintended drive round Chesterfield when I took a right turn which was wrong 
instead of a left turn that was right!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The visits arranged for us 
were to the black and white building called Little Moreton Hall parts of which 
date back to Tudor times. After a pleasant pub lunch, we drove to the very 
interesting Anderton Boat lift where boats are lifted 50ft between the River 
Weaver to the Trent and Mersey canal. This weekend had the most people that have 
ever been on one of these Sprlng weekends, which meant that organiser Bob 
Mackman had needed to work out two different countryside routes so that groups 
of people got to the arranged places at different times. He and wife Sue did a 
great job of organising it all.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Saturday night dinner was 
very good and Chairman Mick Duffy told us that next year would probably be in 
the Bedfordshire/Buckinghamshire area. Sunday morning was fairly free to go 
where you liked, and some of us visited a nearby water mill, which rather like 
the Tardis was very much larger inside than it looked from outside. We then 
drove to the local Jaguar dealer at Wilmslow where some people took the 
opportunity to drive the latest XK, before going on to a large nearby restaurant 
where Sunday lunch had been arranged.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As usual it was good to see 
lots of the familiar faces that we always meet up with on these weekends but 
also nice to see lots of newcomers, including Alan &amp; Barb.

<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Sunshine, 
superb sights, a good mixture of old vehicles, and a scintillating social scene. 
What more could Dick &amp; Eileen, Eric &amp; Margot, Keith &amp; Bobbie &amp; 
Keith &amp; myself have asked for? Once again Whitewebbs Museum organised a 
wonderful weekend.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Keith and I travelled down in 
advance of the rest of our party, mid morning on Friday, as we were afraid of 
missing our chance to go up the Spinnaker Tower (Portsmouth's answer to the 
London Eye but just a static viewing gallery 557 feet high) and take in the 
great views over Portsmouth Harbour and the Isle of Wight. The programme for the 
weekend was tightly packed so it was just as well we made the effort. We also 
had time to stroll down to Emsworth harbour from our hotel, again well worth a 
visit. The hotel itself was family owned - very pleasant and friendly, with good 
food this time for all the 75 visitors from the Enfield Museum.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Saturday was taken up with 
our trip to Portsmouth Naval Dockyard. Our inclusive ticket allowed us to visit 
the Mary Rose &amp; Museum, HMS Victory, HMS Warrior and a boat trip around the 
harbour. There were several other attractions, but not enough time.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Saturday evening's 
entertainment after the meal included the annual 'design a hat' competition, two 
quizzes and a lively disco. Some of our Jaguar party surprised us all with their 
hidden talents! Keith W also begrudgingly joined us on the dance floor after 
muttering several times - "But it's not even New Year's Eve!"</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Sunday morning was fully 
taken with a visit to a Rural Life Centre near Farnham, followed by Sunday Lunch 
at a nearby restaurant. Unfortunately this was owned by a Swiss family of a 
particular strict Christian order, so it was NOT licensed. We paid £5 for the 
privilege of drinking our own wine on their premises - a rather steep corkage 
charge!!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It was an excellent weekend 
and incredible value for money. Look out for the yellow ducks at this year's 
Enfield Pageant. All will be revealed !!

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Just a brief mention of the 
Christmas Dinner at the Old Manor, last month. It seemed to be a popular venue 
again although being a little nearer Christmas, parking was more difficult due 
to the pantomime at the Wyllyots Centre. Thanks to Barbara for her usual 
organisation and Loraine for printing out our menu choices again.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We went to the New Year 
Gathering at Shenley which we found a little disappointing. Compared to the 
numbers of cars that used to be a the Cock O’ the North, the turnout was low and 
with ordinary cars parked with the "oldies" space was at a premium. On the same 
day, Eric went to a meeting at Rickmansworth before going to Shenley, where 
again I believe I’m right in saying that vehicles were a little limited but 
there was an interesting local museum to visit.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On&nbsp;Tuesday 18th January 
Ron Risk took Pam to hospital in Sawbridgeworth for a hip replacement operation. 
Wednesday he took Brian Kingsley to Harefield for heart surgery. Thursday he 
complained of pain in his left side. Friday he went to the doctor's, who sent 
him to hospital. Sunday he had an operation for a twisted hernia! The whole gang 
in different hospitals in different parts of the country! Ron and Pam were both 
returned home on Tuesday and Brian was moved from Harefield to the QE2 at 
Stevenage on Friday 28th which is a better location for most visitors. He was 
feeling quite down on Friday, so on Saturday Sally, Len, Ron and Pam visited him 
at the QE2 and spent a couple of very entertaining hours comparing scars, 
injections, enemas and flatulance! We were all amazed at Brian's recovery. He 
was dressed and walking about and looked very well indeed. Incredible after such 
a major operation! Only draw back he is not allowed to drive for 6 weeks, Ron 
not allowed to drive for 3 weeks and Pam for 3 months, but we're all looking 
forward to making the breakfast run. We would like to thank Len &amp; Sally and 
Keith Williams for visiting and transport, and Wendy &amp; Doug and Alan for 
their best wishes. If you can spare the time, Brian would welcome a phone call 
or a visit. QE2 Hospital, Datchworth Ward. Telephone 01707-365019 Ext. 4245 or

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It's a love affair, my 
relationship with Jaguar, and like the vast majority of others, it begins with 
looks. They have just brought out their latest sports car, the stunning X150 
but, for me, it started way back in the Sixties when I was a kid collecting 
Dinky and Corgi cars. The pride and joy of my collection was a red Jaguar Mark I 
2... a police car version. It fired my imagination because the flickering black 
and white TV programmes of my primary school years were filled with Jaguars, 
either crammed with villains fleeing a bank job or the stylish cops trying to 
foil them. No Hiding Place, Gideon's Way, even The Saint seemed packed with 
them. I loved the racy, curved styling and the oval grille that looked both 
beautiful and menacing at the same time. The Mark 2 boasted lavish chrome, the 
fashion at the time, but was also cosseted with acres of walnut and leather. I 
knew my father, an insurance man on the up at the time, coveted one. He made do 
in those days with a Ford Zephyr (more American, rather more vulgar) and then 
later, trying to redress the balance, a big Wolseley 6/110 ... similar amounts 
of cowhide and forestry sacrificed but much too staid. I promised myself that 
one day... one day... I'd have a Jaguar. A Mark 2. My mind was made up. By the 
time I'd passed my test in the mid-Seventies, the world had changed. The Middle 
East oil crisis was hitting motorists with massive rises in fuel prices (sound 
familiar?) and few car makers were harder hit than Jaguar. Back then, it made 
only big cars: big, fast, and gas guzzling. The fantastic E-type had to go. The 
Mark 2 had long gone, phased out in 1969, and in its place sat the XJ6, still 
highly desirable and much more "modern" but not quite so alluring to me. And I 
could not afford its bonnet, never mind the whole car. And so my early 
car-owning years were filled with Riley Elfs, Ford Consul-Capris and Hillman 
Avengers. Oh dear. Would I ever afford a Jag? Hardly: I once bought a Triumph 
2000 (wood and leather again) but flogged it the same week because I couldn't 
afford the insurance. My brother-in-law bought an XJ6. He was six years older 
and much wealthier than me. How I admired him. Maroon with beige leather, it was 
a beauty. I could still only dream but he allowed me the odd drive. Like John 
"two Jags" Prescott, I was smitten.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Yet I also feared the costs 
of servicing and repairs, even if I could afford one. So the Eighties brought me 
Honda Preludes and, my first classic, a "Saint" Volvo 1800. But how I still 
wanted a Jag. Eventually, I took the plunge. I risked a seven-year-old Jaguar 
XJ40. Metallic green with full beige leather trim. I was earning a few more bob 
and had a company car as back-up now. The Rover went and my "new" Jaguar 
arrived. After more than 20 years, my love affair was consummated. It did not 
let me down. What about the poor reliability I feared? Never missed a heartbeat. 
And they do live and breathe, you know. The Jag -steam locomotives apart - is 
the most animated machine with a wonderful growl under the bonnet and its own 
personality. Two years later came a sportier, beefier, XJR and then, after 
browsing through a car-mart magazine, I saw the ad I could not pull myself away 
from.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Mark 2. Actually, it's a 
1967 Daimler V8 250 but it's the Mark 2 all right. Same body, same wood, same 
leather. The mechanicals differ but it is the same beast -with an even prettier 
oval grille. I bought it. It caused ructions at home but I loved it - and still 
do. I was under orders that my "everyday" XJR had to go, with a sensible car to 
replace it. Something practical... with more miles to the gallon. What did I do? 
I imported a Nissan-based Jaguar Mark 2 lookalike from Japan. A little cutie 
called a Mitsuoka to give me nearly 50mpg. Mad? Very likely but Jaguars do that 
to you. I've still got the Mark 2 but was happy to flog the lookalike in favour 
of the splendid new S-type, introduced six years ago, which is the modern Jag 
paying homage to the Mark 2. Retro curves and the same oval grille but with all 
mod cons: ABS, CD, air-con, electric everything, the whole works. And wood. And 
leather. They may be owned by Ford now; they may have the rather less attractive 
X-type on the model list these days, but they are still Jags. And I'm still in 
love.

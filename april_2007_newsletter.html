size=3><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The first April meeting was Doug's 
first as Area Rep, and he started by thanking Alan for his fifteen years service 
in the position. When Alan took over from Chris Engeham there were three 
volunteers and a vote was held, a luxury that we have not had since. As I 
mentioned last month we now intend to make the post a three year tenure.</DIV>

<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The first Breakfast Run of the season was 
very enjoyable, a lovely summer's day in the middle of April can't be bad, 
although there was early morning fog in the area near the pub. The Bullsmoor 
Lane contingent had to make an early detour as the A10 was cordoned off by 
police, presumably due to an accident. As Roy was using his motorbike, it looked 
as though we had our own outrider.

<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The April 16th meeting was the first time 
that we had held a Quiz Night, and it was good to see some of our lady members 
there; the men needed the extra brain power. Doug and I had never organised a 
quiz before, so we hope everyone enjoyed it. Thirty questions were General 
Knowledge and twenty one were motoring and Jaguar. Interestingly, there was only 
a spread of thirteen points between the lowest score and the winner, who was 
Roy. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>By the time of the next meeting on Bank 
Holiday Monday, 7th May, eight of our members will have been on a weekend to 
Portsmouth with the EDVVS and Alan &amp; Barb are joining us on an XK weekend to 
Cheshire. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There is an interesting meeting at 
Silverstone over that weekend. France brought details for us but if you haven't 
seen them, everything is on the Silverstone website. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The May newsletter will probably not be 
circulated before the Enfield Pageant, so just a reminder to be on site by no 
later than 9 a.m. and if you are normally responsible for bringing anything, 
don't forget. A reminder that tea, coffee, bacon rolls etc. are provided, but 
mugs are not. Any queries at all about the Pageant, ring Eric. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Looking ahead a bit further to some other 
events that have been recommended in the past by members. Now that I have joined 
the wonderful world of Google, I have been checking some of them out. The first 
of these is the Luton Festival of Transport on 10th June. Eric has been to this 
in the past and last year they had 1100 vehicles and fifty clubs. Pre-booked 
entries are free for driver and passenger or £3 on the day. There is free entry 
to the Vauxhall Heritage Centre.

<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I was often told that the Kimbolton Country 
Fayre was a very good show so I've looked that one up as well. It is on July 
15th and organised by the Sporting Bears. I have seen a long list of the 
attractions that were there last year including 700 classic cars. It does sound 
a similar show to how Chigwell used to be. Kimbolton is a little to the west of 
the A1 just past St Neots. If there is any interest I will check out the details 
nearer the time. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Those of you who receive the newsletter by 
E-mail will have seen the details that David Holland sent us about a show on 5th 
August at Helvingham Hall in Suffolk, which like the Kimbolton Show may be too 
far for some, but could also be a nice day out, after all quite a few of us used 
to go as far as Bressingham for East Anglian Day. There were over 400 cars there 
last year. I have a phone contact (01473-890799) but if you are able to follow 
up the information on David's E-mail or go directly to www.helminghamhall.com 
all the details about various pre-booking can be found there. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the meeting on the 16th we discussed the 
possibility of having a Sunday lunch at the Woodman where we go for our 
Breakfast runs; it had been suggested by the lady there. Barb is going to follow 
this up for us to see what they would do for what price and to check dates. 
Hopefully more details next time. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The idea of a boat trip has also been 
raised and Keith O is going to see what he can find out for us. Another idea, 
which would probably have to be done at short notice is a club picnic; 
suggestions for a suitable venue would be welcome. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Have you started thinking about Christmas 
yet? Alan found that some bookings had already been made at Pearse House so with 
the agreement of those present at the last meeting he has booked us in on 
Saturday 8th December. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Have you sent for the free DVD from JDC 
yet? We have only seen some of it so far but it looks to be a good record of the 
Club's history. As our car is the first one seen, perhaps we can be forgiven a 
little prejudice.

us gathered at the Plough, Cattlegate Road on December 8th for our Christmas 
Dinner. We were looked after well in the conservatory restaurant which we had to 
ourselves for the evening. It seemed a little quieter than our Christmas dinners 
have been in the past, maybe the barely audible background music could have gone 
up a little bit. We did not have the usual noisy bits and pieces that Dick and 
Eileen usually bring and our two flying balloons didn&#8217;t survive very long. On 
the other hand it may just have been that Eric wasn&#8217;t there!! Barbara did her 
usual good job of reminding people what they had ordered and collecting up the 
money, and it seemed that a good time was had by all.

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#008000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>WITH its 
beautiful curves, impeccable heritage and powerful five-litre engine, it 
attracts hordes of admirers to the Jaguar museum every year. The Jaguar XJ13 is 
the ultimate dream machine because it is the car that nobody in the world can 
afford. Now two car enthusiasts have effectively offered blank cheques to get 
their hands on the famous racer that never made it to the track. One Japanese 
collector even offered a staggering £7million for the original, with a US rival 
telling Jaguar to name its price to build him a copy. But Jaguar has refused, 
saying they have the only version and would like to keep it that way. Anders 
Clausager, chief archivist at the museum, said: "There is only one XJ13 in 
existence and we have it here at the museum. We believe there is a replica 
somewhere in Australia, but this is the real thing. Not surprisingly there are 
queues of people wanting to see it.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#008000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>"It was built 
in 1966 as a prototype, when Jaguar was considering returning to motor racing. 
It was very advanced for its time and could do 178mph, which in 1966 was pretty 
good." The XJ13 was the fastest Jaguar around at that time, Clausager believes. 
Its performance was much better than that of the E-Type, which could reach 
"only" 150mph. The XJ13 was also the first Jaguar to have its engine housed 
between the driver and the rear wheels, making it much nimbler than its 
rivals.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#008000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Despite the 
interest it has attracted from collectors, Jaguar doesn't wish to build a copy. 
"We cannot see the point in replicas," Mr Clausager says. "It's a free country 
and, if someone wants to copy a classic Jaguar, we are not going to stop them. 
We think it's a pointless exercise - but not everyone can afford a real Van Gogh 
in their dining-room, so I can sort of see their point."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#008000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>After the 
prototype XJ13 was built in 1966, Jaguar intended to unveil it in the Le Mans 
24-hour race, where it would have left the competition standing in the dust. But 
the car never had its heyday after the French race organisers changed the rules 
about engine capacity. The merger between BMC and Jaguar - the move that created 
British Motor Holdings - also led to the project being mothballed, so the car 
was kept under wraps. At the time, the company was so worried that news of the 
car's existence would leak out - and harm sales of the new six-cylinder E-type - 
that Jaguar boss Sir William Lyons instructed that the car was not to be 
circuit-tested. But Norman Dewis, then chief development tester for Jaguar, 
recalled that his boss Bill Heynes suggested the car should be given a run in 
spite of Sir William's orders. So, early one Sunday morning, the XJ13 was taken 
to the Motor Industry Research Association test centre near Nuneaton. Mr Dewis 
clocked up 175mph on the straight with the car lapping at 161.6mph - an 
unofficial lap record. But Mr Dewis almost paid a hefty price for his curiosity. 
Sir William summoned him to his office when he heard about the unofficial trial 
and read the Riot Act. Since Dewis was so enthusiastic about the car, however, 
he asked what the result of the test had been. And two weeks later, the car 
returned to the test track for another circuit - this time with Sir William 
watching.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#008000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>To check how 
the car would performed on a real racing circuit, the XJ13 was tested at 
Silverstone, and performed well against other racing cars. Far more work was 
needed, though, to turn the car into a Le Mans winner. This would have meant 
diverting work away from other production cars, so the XJ13 was again shelved. 
Despite this, many of the lessons learned in developing the XJ13's engine were 
incorporated into the V12 unit that was introduced into the E-Type in 1972. That 
link was not lost on the publicity people, and they decided to use the XJ13 in 
the opening of a film to announce the new V12 E-Type.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#008000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>But disaster 
struck during filming. As Mr Dewis reached speeds of 140mph, the tremendous 
G-forces exerted on the car led to the Jag's rear offside wheel collapsing under 
the strain. The car flipped end-over-end twice before rolling. Amazingly, Mr 
Dewis emerged unscathed although the unique car was a complete write-off. Under 
normal circumstances the car would have been broken up for scrap. But the 
wreckage stayed in the factory for two years before the company decided to 
restore it.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#008000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>The XJ13 now 
sits in the museum and is one of its biggest attractions. And Mr Dewis, though 
now in his eighties, still puts the car through its paces at exhibitions. "He is 
very quick to complain if the car isn't performing well," said Mr Clausager. 
"He'll tell us how he remembers it being much faster in its heyday and we'll 
have to give it a tune-up."</FONT></P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A few months ago, it was mentioned 
in the XK News Section of Jaguar Driver that you could apply to the Fee paying 
Section at DVLA to enquire about previous owners of your vehicle for a £5 
charge. I sent off £10 to get details of Doug&#8217;s XK and E-type. Eventually a 
thick envelope came back. There were several pages for each vehicle; however for 
the XK there was nothing before Doug bought it in 1967 with no reason given for 
lack of any further information. A barely legible photo copy did show previous 
owners of the E-type. As none of the telephone choices at the DVLA were 
applicable, I wrote back to try and find out why there was not further 
information about the XK. The response has been absolutely nothing, so if you do 
try this, don&#8217;t hold out too much hope.

Tour and Discovery Trail, 11th and 12th October 2003</U></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B></B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We have always enjoyed 
actively using our Daimler 2.5 rather than cosseting it, or just attending 
shows, so over the years we have taken part in many events, some several times: 
e.g. the Footman James Retrorun, the Haynes 2 day Classic, the London to 
Brighton run, the Norwich Union (and then Guardian) 3 day Classic, etc. Many of 
these have been great fun and taken us to new and different places so we tend to 
keep our eyes open for different events.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>This year I received details 
of the 5th North Wiltshire Tour and Discovery Trail and was surprised to have 
never heard of it before: how had 4 passed by unnoticed? This is organised by 
part of the North Wiltshire District Council with the intention of promoting 
tourism in the area but is a thoroughly professional event. This year&#8217;s theme 
was "Hauntings and Happenings." The entry fee of £180 per car with 2 adults 
seems quite steep at first sight but when you think what is included it actually 
is good value for money: route information for 2 full days in the form of 
"tulip" notes, free admission to all the places visited, morning and afternoon 
refreshments each day, lunch each day and a superb waitress service formal 
dinner on the Saturday evening followed by a firework display and dancing to a 
live band. Oh, and I nearly forgot a major attraction - 6 laps (many actually 
had more) of Castle Combe track to finish off with. No better way to blow the 
cobwebs away.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We drove down from London 
early on Saturday morning and joined the other 74 cars (ranging in age from a 
1929 Austin to a 2002 Mini Cooper Clubsport, with a variety of Allards, 
Bentleys, Jaguars, Morgans in between, plus even a Roller, Ferrari and other 
fast modern machinery such as Porches, a TVR, etc.) at Hartham Park, near 
Corsham. Our route then took us to the National Trust village of Laycock and on 
to Chippenham, Corsham, the Starfall Pottery, Castle Combe Village and the 
Rattlebone inn at Sherston. At most of the towns we were greeted by the mayor 
and presented with small gifts (fudge, pens, etc.) We also had check points and 
an ongoing quiz with answers that had to be found at our stopping points. At 
each check point and for each correct quiz answer we were given a piece of a 
jigsaw. By the end of the weekend the idea was that each participant would have 
a complete, and specially commissioned "5th North Wiltshire Tour and Discovery 
Trail" jigsaw. We, and many other participants, managed to succeed in this 
objective. Oh yes, and one more thing: for those who wanted there were driving 
skills tests to take at various places along the route. We choose to do this but 
won no prizes: too much enthusiasm and too little accuracy.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We visited many other places 
including Westonbirt Arboretum, Kemble Airfield and the Bristol Aero Collection, 
Minchinghampton Common, Keynes Country Park &#8211; and that was day just on the first 
day. On Sunday we enjoyed Calne, the Atwell Wilson Motor Museum (quite 
extraordinary if you have never been there), Avebury, Butterfly World, Wooton 
Bassett and had Sunday lunch at the Blunsden House Hotel. The last stages took 
us through Cricklade, Malmesbury, Grittleton School and finally to Castle Combe 
for some tyre warming fun.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>At the end of Sunday there 
were many awards and happy smiling faces. The only bad bit was the return 
journey to London via a heavily congested M4. Including the outward and return 
legs to London we covered 466 miles so if you only cover a hundred miles a year 
in your Jaguar this is not the weekend for you! Would the 6th tour be a good 
event for Area 57 to plan to have several cars at? If so book the dates now: 9th 
and 10th October 2004. And we found a very good local B&amp;B for Saturday night 
if any of you are interested.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>P.S. some of you were 
understandably a bit puzzled at the Kelvedon Hatch nuclear bunker visit when I 
kept blowing our horns. Unfortunately there was an intermittent short of the 
horn wiring inside the steering column and every time we made a right hand turn 
the horns would blow! All very embarrassing, particularly on roundabouts so we 
eventually had to disconnect them.

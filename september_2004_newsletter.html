<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">For traditionalists the news that 
Jaguar production is to cease at Browns Lane is sad. I suppose, however, that it 
is inevitable that economics outweigh sentiment. It does seem strange though, 
that the traditional British Racing Green used in the company&#8217;s corporate 
identity is to change to black, with all the costs that this will involve. It is 
also being suggested that the "leaper" should be modernised.

Holiday Monday</U></B></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Although the EDVVS 
used to hold shows at Trent Park quite a few years ago, this was the first time 
that they had been back since combining with the Heavy Horse Association. It&#8217;s a 
much more level site than Holly Hill Farm so it was easier to get the tent pegs 
in, especially as it was always rather stony there. As far as Area 57 goes it is 
the usual bacon roll start to the day, once the banner etc. is up. I can&#8217;t 
remember who first thought of doing our own bacon rolls several years ago, but 
it has proved to be a very popular idea.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The show was the usual mix of steam 
engines, cars, heavy horses and various stalls. Dave Norton did his usual good 
job of describing cars as they did a couple of circuits around the arena. He 
handed over commentary to a representative of the H.H.A., who explained the 
differences between the various types of heavy horse breeds and their harness 
and vehicles. The weather seemed to be under the impression that it was April as 
it alternated between brilliant sunshine and very heavy downpours, so our new 
tent was well and truly christened.

<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">This was the first 
time that Doug and I have been to this show, and we found it a pleasant relaxing 
day. Our XK joined the E-types of Alan, Len, Brian K., Brian F. and Ron. We 
managed to park almost together, just being split by an Allard saloon that we 
had seen at Trent Park, which went on to win the prize for the most 
unusual/interesting category. As is the case with Hoddesdon, there seems a 
different atmosphere at town centre shows. There was a varied selection of cars 
plus a few tractors and plenty of motor bikes. The organisers had managed to put 
together a special James Bond display, complete with the green XK8 from the 
latest Bond film and a Pierce Brosnan look-a-like. This was raising money for 
Cancer UK so they probably did quite well. I believe I am right in saying that 
the other prize winners were an XK150 DHC (most desirable) and an Austin 7 (best 
condition). Brilliant sunshine made the day and most of us sat on the shady side 
of the road. Needless to say, Len and Sally didn&#8217;t!

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">SEPTEMBER WEEKEND - NR 
TEWKESBURY</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">After a spell of lovely weather, the 
forecast for our weekend away at the Corse Lawn Hotel near Tewksbury was pretty 
gloomy to say the least. However, apart from an extremely heavy shower when we 
were nearly there, we were very lucky and had plenty of sunshine. We set off 
from Potters Bar with the Rogers and Oswicks, the latter in a borrowed X-type. 
We stopped for a very pleasant lunch at a pub between Aylesbury and Bicester. 
When we reached the hotel we found that Phil and Heather, Len and Sally and 
Keith and Audrey had beaten us by about half an hour. Although plenty of hotels 
have grounds, very few have gardens but here there were beds of dahlias 
everywhere. Our rooms, most named after local villages were very good, large and 
well appointed; real tea, not tea bags, cafetiere, fresh fruit and home made 
biscuits.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">After an excellent dinner it was 
time to test the brains with al light hearted quiz and test the steady hands 
with Jenga (a tower of wooden bricks for those unfamiliar with the game). At 
breakfast on Saturday morning we all agreed to visit the Gloucestershire and 
Warwickshire Railway which started from a village about twenty minutes away. The 
other end of the line was at Cheltenham Race Course, ten miles away. Although 
they do hope eventually to extend to Stratford on Avon, at present the railway 
doesn&#8217;t enter Warwickshire at all. It does mean that they can call themselves 
the G.W.R. though. We broke our journey at Winchcombe and had a stroll down to 
the pretty little town about a mile from the station for a light lunch, before 
completing the journey. The dinner that night was just as good as Friday&#8217;s and 
then another quiz and more brain exercise in "Pass the Bomb", a game guaranteed 
to make even bookworms forget most words that they know.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">All too soon it was Sunday morning 
and while the rest of us spent some time in Tewkesbury, Phil and Heather headed 
towards Bristol to their daughter&#8217;s, Len and Sally were off to Bicester Shopping 
Village for some retail therapy.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Although I put forward a selection 
of brochures for these weekends, I&#8217;m just as much in the dark as everyone else 
as to how satisfactory the hotel will turn out to be. It is very gratifying to 
find one as good as Corse Lawn.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A few of our cars were at a charity 
show at Fanshawes recently and also at Enfield Town Park, which I gather was 
closed for a while as an armed response unit had to deal with someone who was 
threatening his girlfriend with a chainsaw I know a few people also had a trip 
to Browns Lane which I am hoping may be reported on in the future.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Four Area 57 cars attended a very 
friendly show. The weather was good, and the food in the hotel was excellent. I 
received an award for pre 1960 cars, (there were only two, but it sounds good 
doesn&#8217;t it?). An enjoyable event. I will be going again next year.

<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Eric, myself and two friends took our XKs up the 
North Circular Road to Park Royal and the famous Ace Cafe. It is a very friendly 
place, with cars and motorbikes on show. We had a meal, and I have to say thet 
the traditional sausage and mash was very good. Another one to add to my list of 
return visits.

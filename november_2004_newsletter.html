<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We are coming to the time 
when Alan has to miss several Monday meetings due to rehearsals. On these 
occasions, I don&#8217;t usually call a meeting but if anyone wants to bring anything 
to the club&#8217;s attention, please feel free to take the floor at around nine-ish.

MUSEUM - 14th November 2004</FONT></U></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Thanks to Eric 
for arranging our trip to this fascinating musum, dedicated to various forms of 
transport. Obviously, cars form the major part of the exhibits. In the main, 
they are "ordinary" cars rather than exotics; making it a case of all our 
yesterdays. Plenty of motor bikes were also there, plus military vehicles, an 
American fire engine, a couple of gypsy caravans, plus numerous lawn mowers. 
Outside there is a replica of Captain Cook&#8217;s ship "Endeavour" which is still 
being fitted out internally.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The owner of the Museum, Mr. 
F.J. Saunders started collecting and renovating vehicles about twenty five years 
ago and the wish to share these exhibits led to the opening of the museum back 
in 1994.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>In true Area 57 style we had 
started our outing with Sunday lunch at "The Crown" in the nearby village of 
Shillington.

Audrey &amp; Keith Williams</I></B></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The weather 
forecast was abysmal so once again the E-type had to stay indoors for the 
weekend! It was a pleasant drive on Friday morning &amp; we stopped off for 
lunch at a nice hostelry near Farringdon &#8211; The Trout at Tadpole 
Bridge.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Once we had booked in at the 
Blunsdon House Hotel we ventured into the outskirts of Swindon to a large 
designer outlet mall. The steam museum was just alongside but there wasn&#8217;t 
enough time to do it justice.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It was a very busy weekend at 
the hotel &#8211; weddings, parties ,other club meets etc. etc. They&#8217;re fully booked 
till February 2005 and they have 168 bedrooms! The meal arrangements were for 
the carvery so we had to queue with everyone else. The food was enjoyable enough 
but rather limited choices by the third day!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On Saturday we all went in 
convoy to the Cotswold Motor Museum at Bourton-on-the-water in the pouring rain. 
Some interesting exhibits including a 1937 Swallow, vintage caravans &amp; 
plenty of related paraphernalia. We had an early cream tea afterwards 
(lunchtime!) and because of the dreadful weather headed back to the hotel to 
sample the leisure facilities.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On Sunday morning in the 
sunshine we all drove together again to the Atwell-Wilson Car Museum at Calne. 
This was a strange little place just behind the owner&#8217;s bungalow! The collection 
began in 1962 and is very varied from a rare Riley 9, to an even rarer Allard 
Alvis Speed 20, to a Sinclair C5 and some interesting motorcycles. The wedding 
fleet of 29 cars was impressive &#8211; including a model T Ford, the mighty 
Rolls-Royce &amp; Cadillacs to the diminutive but elegant Little Singer. &#8211; all 
in tip-top condition. We were pleased to see lottery money had paid for the 
substantial new garages/halls to house the 70+ collection.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We returned to Blunsdon for 
lunch &amp; presentations. There had been 2 quizes this time over the weekend. 
One was particularly tricky &#8211; the people who got 3/12 answers right won the 
prize!! We&#8217;ll try them out on one of our weekends away . Danny &amp; Mary Smith 
were presented with a barometer/clock in a smart wooden case for all their hard 
work in organising the weekend. Sadly it was their last time and George with 
Sylvie&#8217;s help are planning the next one to the New Forest around Easter next 
year.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Again a very enjoyable 
weekend and terrific value even though there were only 30+ of us this time. We 
had one little black sheep (footstool) in our bedroom &#8211; but the hotel was being 
re-furbished throughout &#8211; so the flock of sheep at Blunsdon , which some of you 
may remember &#8211; may well disappear forever in the modernisation process !!

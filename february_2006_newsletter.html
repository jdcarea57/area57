<DIV align=justify><FONT size=2><FONT size=3><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Quite a 
number of you will not have heard that Alan had an accident recently. He was 
knocked off his motorbike and broke his leg. Unfortunately he had a mini stroke 
while in hospital and is having tests to try and find out the cause. At the time 
of writing, he was able to get around the ward on crutches so progress is being 
made. I’m sure the entire club sends its best wishes to Alan for a speedy 
recovery.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<P align=justify><I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">(I have since spoken to Alan on 
the phone, he is now home and in good spirits. Roy.)

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">He is adamant that there is no 
reason to postpone our 20th celebrations on Saturday 25th March. This will be a 
running buffet throughout the evening from about 7.00 p.m. As I mentioned last 
time the only cost involved will be your drinks as club funds will be paying for 
the food. We hope to have all the club photo albums on display and possibly 
early videos of the club. It will be an informal evening but as you can 
appreciate, Alan and Barbara need to know numbers so that they can arrange 
things with the catering staff at Pearse House. Hopefully, as many of you as 
possible will come along but can you let Barbara know IN WRITING please, by 18th 
March. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Barbara has started taking names and 
£5.50 per head for the first Breakfast Run of the season, to Rickling Green on 
9th April. Call her for bookings.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It has been mentioned recently that 
as we have not been to so many JDC events over the past few years, the occasion 
of our 20th seemed a good time to go as an Area to the JDC 50th celebrations on 
Sunday 21st May. Dick has had confirmation from Nik Drukker that we can have an 
area to ourselves at Heythrop Park. This is not very far from Chipping Norton in 
Oxfordhire; the nearest village is Enstone. We have driven through that area and 
I know there are plenty of signs to Heythrop Park. Nik needs to know a rough 
idea of the space we will want, and we will try and collect names within the 
next few weeks. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">As usual Eric will be liaising with 
the EDVVS for the Enfield Pageant and will be collecting names nearer the time. 
Our display will be on May 28th and 29th. Bearing in mind our 20th anniversary 
we hope to make our stand even better than usual. Further into the year, on 
August Bank Holiday Monday, Dick will be organising passes for the Trent Park 
Steam Show. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Another couple of dates that are 
connected with the EDVVS are the car show at Fanshawes, in Hertford on Sunday 
2nd July, and the Hoddesdon Town Show on Saturday 8th July. Brian Kingsley will 
take bookings for the first of these. Most people who have attended Hoddesdon 
before will hear from them direct.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Some of you will know that Richard 
Freestone and his Bentley are at present in New Zealand. He has been keeping 
Keith Williams up to date via E-mail. He seems to be having a good time, 
starting with a stop in Bangkok to see the sights!! Singapore and Hong Kong were 
other places visited before reaching New Zealand. The Bentley has been behaving 
well. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">You will&nbsp;shortly receive your 
voting slips for the John Dyall Trophy, by post. As usual this will be presented 
at the A.G.M. on 20th March and is awarded for services to the club. Just a 
reminder that the previous holders have been, Roy, Barbara, myself, Eric and 
Dick. If you have anything you would like to raise for discussion at the A.G.M., 
please contact Alan in advance of the meeting. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Finally, thanks to Keith Oswick for 
organising our visit to the Traffic Control Centre at South Mimms. We were given 
an interesting talk by Jon Caldwell who is in charge of the Eastern Region. The 
livery for their vehicles on the motorways is similar to the police but they are 
part of the Highways Agency. Their main function is to keep traffic moving, 
whether by means of the variable speed limits, so familiar on the M25, or 
setting up diversions at accidents. They hope that they now have the number of 
vehicles and personnel available to prevent the chaos that was on the M11 when 
people were snowed in for hours. Luckily we have not had the snow to test the 
system. Everyone seemed to find it an interesting evening and on Alan’s behalf, 
I have written to Mr Caldwell expressing our 
thanks.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

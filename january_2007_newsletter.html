size=3><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I must begin this Newsletter with a 
couple of apologies; firstly if anyone went to the Legion on New Year's Day and 
found no-one there, we are sorry.&nbsp; Several of us were at Dick and Eileen's 
with the intention of going on to the meeting.&nbsp; We realised that those of 
us who were there could well be the only ones going anyway, so we rang a few 
people to let them know and Dick popped round to leave a note only to find that 
the Legion wasn't open anyway. The other apology is to Dick Rogers &amp; Keith 
Oswick as I should have mentioned last month that they are now members of the 
EDVVS Committee. 
<HR>
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Although Christmas &amp; the 
New Year seem to be fading rapidly into the past, just a couple of recaps of 
what went on. Surprisingly the Mince Pie night saw a low attendance; some people 
really don't book their holidays at very good times!!! I gather that quite a few 
people went to Nazeing on the day after Boxing Day and there was a very good 
turnout of interesting cars at St Albans on New Year's Day. As this is a 
gathering organised by the Bentley &amp; Vintage Sports Car Club our cars are 
mere babes compared to some of the vehicles there. Pride of place probably went 
to a Stanley Steamer charabanc dated about 1912. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the last meeting we 
started to try and get some things organised for the coming year. We have made a 
provisional booking on April 15th for breakfast at the Woodman at Nuthampstead. 
Dick &amp; Eric found a pub with good food that could take a group of about 
eighteen for Sunday lunch. It is The Green Man at Little Braxted near Witham. No 
dates have been agreed yet but as with some of the other things I'm mentioning, 
it's a case of watch this space. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>In the past , the possibility 
of Tenpin Bowling has been mentioned, Alan is going to check it out at Bishops 
Stortford as the one at Stevenage might not be very convenient for people. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Doug and I are going to 
organise a quiz which would be part Jaguar questions and part general knowledge. 
Hopefully we would be able to use the television room so that everyone could 
hear properly. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Several years ago Dick &amp; 
Eileen organised a games evening, things like Jenga, shovehalfpenny, card games 
of the cheat variety (nothing serious ) etc. They would be happy to do this 
again if a suitable date can be arranged. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Hopefully some definite dates 
can be agreed on by the time I write the February Newsletter. Any other 
suggestions for outings etc. are always welcome. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Looking further ahead a show 
at Barleylands near Billericay has been mentioned, but that is not till July so 
there is plenty of time to find out more about that one. Shows that are more 
than just a car show are obviously the ones that are of most interest. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On a totally different 
subject, some of you will remember the great potato contest that Eric &amp; Dick 
had last year; they intend to do it again but I believe that Eric intends to be 
the judge this time so Dick is looking for some competion. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A few weeks before Christmas 
some of the "boys" went to the Ace Cafe on a Sunday morning; they happened to be 
filming a show in the "Look Ten Years Younger" makeover series for Channel 4, we 
will probably never hear the last of it, but Eric was one of those interviewed 
for the programme, due to be shown sometime in March. He assures me that he is 
not the one getting the makeover. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>In March we will be having 
our Annual General meeting as usual, which raises two points. The John Dyall 
Trophy is awarded at this meeting for services to the Club; this was originally 
for services during the previous year, but it was felt that this narrowed the 
choice too much and it was agreed that it would now be for services throughout 
the Club's existence. I realise that many of you, while being very welcome 
members of the club do not take a very active part, so understandably feel that 
they don't know people well enough to vote. Last year Alan only received 
eighteen voting slips back, however, as we regularly get twenty plus on 
Breakfast Runs and we had thirty plus for the Christmas dinner, it seems that 
some of the more regular members have not been voting either. The previous 
winners have been Roy, Barbara, myself, Eric, Dick and Keith Oswick and, in my 
personal opinion, there are two people not on this list who have both done a 
tremendous amount for the club over the years. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Alan has once again expressed 
his intention to retire as Area Rep at the AGM, and would like some nominations 
as a replacement. Obviously any nominee would have to agree to their name going 
forward.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Guide to British pubs: The 
Holly Bush Potters Crouch, near St Albans, Herts (01727 851792).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>By Christopher 
Middleton</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From the outside, it looks as 
if a wicked witch has cast a spell on the Holly Bush. The little white cottage 
is not so much covered in wisteria as strangled by it.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Step inside and the fairy 
tale continues. The low shiny ceiling, the misshapen wooden beams, the gleaming 
spick-and-span-ness of the tables, the homeliness of the candelabra and 
crockery, the tiny red lightshades that look like glowing fairies' corsets — 
surely this establishment must be the home of house-proud pixies.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Well, of course, it isn’t, 
this being Hertfordshire and not hobbit country. Even so, you'd be hard put to 
find a more neatly-put-together landlord than the long-serving Ray Taylor. You 
know he's called Ray Taylor by the number of framed certificates on the walls 
testifying to his proficiency in everything from ale preservation to pub-garden 
maintenance (pheasants pop in from time to time). Even if you didn't know his 
name, you could match the immaculacy of his suit-and-tie turnout with the 
symmetry of his certificate deployment. The little laminated notices could well 
be his work, too: No Smoking At The Bar, No Dogs, No Service At This 
Bar.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Everything here is calm, 
orderly, unbuffeted by the winds outside. A menu in symbolically unbending 
plastic is a roll-call of traditional British bar food circa 1970: smoked salmon 
sandwiches, prawn sandwiches with Marie Rose sauce, filled baked potatoes and, 
as a nod to the 1980s, chilli con came (a massive splurge for £6.10)</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The bitter, as always, is 
Fullers, from Chiswick, west London. The ESB (5.5% abv) glides down like a 
powerful Rolls-Royce. The London Pride (4.1%) is Jaguar-smooth, though with 
slightly less under the bonnet than the ESB.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Speaking of motorised 
transport, the Holly Bush stands in open countryside that estate agents would 
call "twixt the motorways" (Ml and M10), down a pleasant, hedge-free little road 
called Ragged Hall Lane, no more than 45 minutes on foot from St Albans town 
centre. It's well worth the walk, too, though it's best perhaps to get a taxi 
back. Somehow the return journey seems so much 
further.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

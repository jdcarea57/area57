<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>XK WEEKEND - June 25th to 
27th</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>The weekend 
incorporating XK Day was back on the familiar territory of Stamford and Burghley 
House where the event was held for several years. A sunny Friday morning saw the 
three XKs leave Dick and Eileen&#8217;s. However, we were no further along the A10 
than the Hertford area, when Eric flashed his lights at Doug to stop as he had 
seen Dick pull up in what looked like a cloud of smoke. We headed off to the 
next junction and came back on ourselves till we saw Dick&#8217;s 150 in a lay-by. The 
smoke had turned out to be steam after a core plug had blown. He arranged to be 
picked up by the AA and said they would see us at Stamford later with his 
Daimler Double Six. Eric, John and ourselves went on, stopping for lunch at The 
Red House, where we are to have breakfast on 18th July. On reaching Stamford we 
parked in the Lady Anne Hotel car park where Eric and John were staying and then 
had a wander around the town. At about five p.m. we found that Eileen and Dick 
had arrived at the B &amp; B where the four of us were staying at the other end 
of town. It was a lovely old Edwardian house, where the owner had installed a 
security camera in the car park which we could monitor on our bedroom TV. We met 
up with Eric and John at a local hostelry for an evening meal. On Saturday 
morning we joined several other XKs at the Lady Anne to be given our routes to 
Butterfly Farm not far from Spalding. On the way back to Stamford we visited a 
Romany Museum to see a large collection of gypsy caravans and watch a video 
about their history. By this time it was pouring with rain, so Doug and I were a 
bit soggy.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>For the first time the XK 
dinner at the Lady Anne that evening was a dance as well and after Chairman 
Brian Davis gave out the various awards we were entertained by a very enjoyable 
small group and lady singer.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Luckily the sun was shining 
again on Sunday morning for the short drive to Burghley House for XK Day. I 
didn&#8217;t count how many cars were there but certainly not the number there used to 
be. After lunch in the Orangery and a bit more socialising with familiar faces 
it was time to head home with a stop for tea and cake at the Westmill Tea Room.

<P></P></FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3><B><U>HODDESDON TOWN CENTRE SHOW 
- 10th July 2004</U></B></FONT> 
<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Over the years 
this show has had a remarkably good weather record, but all things change. 
Plenty of sunshine to start with, but by lunch time the rain had set in. Even 
so, I don&#8217;t think very many cars left early. Our nine cars were joined by the 
Jaguar engined Allard belonging to friends of ours. It seemed that this year 
there were more cars and people than the last couple of years have seen. Keith 
and Audrey were not able to be there this year and extend their usual post show 
hospitality as it was Laura&#8217;s graduation day. Well done Laura and where have the 
years gone?!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>In the SS Register News in 
the Jaguar Driver it recently mentioned that long summer evenings were the ideal 
time to drive out to their regular meeting place at Potters Crouch. On July 
12th, six of our cars joined Dick, but a lovely summer evening would not be a 
very accurate description. We were able to sit outside but it was quite a grey 
evening.

July 2004</U></B></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>It seems as 
though we can&#8217;t get enough of Breakfast runs as this was our first mid-season 
run. Dick had organised it for us at The Red House to the north of Royston. Most 
people left from Bullsmoor Lane and we had a good clear run, further than 
Rickling Green but no-one seemed to mind that. After the usual fruit juice and 
cereals it was help yourselves to all we could eat from what seemed like never 
ending supplies of bacon, sausages, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms, black pudding, 
scrambled and fried eggs and fried bread, followed by toast and marmalade and 
jam. Plentiful refills of coffee and tea were constantly available. I know Dick 
confirmed numbers with them a couple of days before hand but I think that they 
must have thought we all had American sized appetites. Unfortunately, it began 
to rain while we were there so most of the way home was quite wet.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Thanks Dick.

Mick &amp; Jacqui Stubbings</I></B></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>This car show 
was organised by Vicky Blackburn, and we must say that Vicky made getting into 
the event so easy. Once into the show ground you were directed straight to the 
spot that had been allocated to you. As soon as the cars were parked out came 
the seats, the tables, and the drinks. We had just sat down when the 
unmistakeable smell of bacon being cooked wafted across. Some of us resisted the 
temptation, others could not.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>There was a good showing of 
Club cars although nobody from Area 57 won a prize. Wayne and Graham were going 
around helping people to have a good day. We had gone ready for bad weather but 
although it did cloud over a few times and threatened to rain, it came to 
nothing. So, carrying on the area 57 tradition, we munched our way through quite 
a selection of foods, while Len and Sally suffered having to soak up the 
sunshine.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>It was great to meet up and 
have a pleasant day with fellow members of the Area.

<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>And now it's 
live to the first ever London Grand Prix...</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Welcome back to the old 
revolving restaurant of the Telecom Tower, where we're covering this truly 
historic race. Just give me a moment until the view comes round again and I can 
tell you what's going on...</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>And what a race it's been so 
far, full of thrills, spills and not a few jams. We kicked off to a great 
fanfare, with the pack revving up on the starting grid outside the Carphone 
Warehouse at the top of the Hanger Lane Gyratory. Starting positions were 
decided by lottery, remember, because Ken Livingstone's controversial decision 
to keep the traffic on the road during the race ruled out a qualifying round. 
Places on the grid were drawn using Camelot's machine, Guinevere, because it 
sounds a bit like Genevieve, the much-loved film about another famous car race 
across London.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>More than 250,000 race fans 
counted down the lights from red to amber to green... and back to red again as 
the driver of an articulated truck got into an argument with a white van man 
about who should be the pace car and blocked all three southbound lanes until he 
got his way. Three hours later and the cars have finally made it to King's 
Cross. The first pitstop came at Harley Street, where several drivers stopped 
off for much-needed testosterone injections. Shortly after, it looked as though 
we were going to have to say goodbye to the Minardis when the impoverished team 
discovered it couldn't afford the congestion charge. Fortunately, Mayor 
Livingstone came to the rescue by proposing they join his car-share 
scheme.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>On to Oxford Street, where 
the cars struggle to fight their way through the thousands of petrolheads 
crammed in buses, coaches and taxis who are flooding the capital to, er, watch 
the grand prix. Not to mention the hordes of well-spoken ladies heading for the 
Debenhams, who can't understand why the sales are so busy. Now look at that! 
Ralf Schumacher's having a heated debate with a kindly gentleman who's Squeegeed 
his wind-screen and wants 50p for his trouble. Jenson Button's nipped into 
Hamleys to pick up some PlayStation games and Juan Pablo Montoya goes off to the 
Trocadero to try out the PepsiMax ride ("Much scarier than Fl," he 
admits).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>As Rubens Barrichello lands a 
fine for using the bus lane in an enthralling duel with a cycle rickshaw, 
marshals speed things up and divert the race through Old Holborn and along the 
Strand to Pall Mall. Is there nothing Bemie Ecclestone won't try to get round 
the ban on tobacco advertising? Into the Mall, on goes the power and through the 
gears they go/ First! Second! Third! And first again, as Takuma Sato cuts a 
corner across St James's Park, sending deckchairs flying but swerving to avoid a 
flock of flinty-eyed pigeons.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>As the field rounds 
Buckingham Comer, Button pulls an outrageous left-hand doughnut to salute Her 
Majesty the Queen up on the balcony (who's still furious that David Beckham 
hasn't won Wimbledon yet). Through the Victoria chicane, dropping to 27mph as 
they go past New Scotland Yard, the first cars are then lapped as Big Ben sweeps 
into view. Oh yes, it's stragglers Christian Klien and Mark Webber, much to the 
annoyance of Deputy PM John Prescott, who had big money on the two 
Jags.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Hard on the brakes as they 
round Parliament Square, the drivers cross the Thames and pop in for a tyre 
change at the Kwik-Fit in Vauxhall, head on to Battersea Bridge, up King's Road 
and through Sloane Square. Jamo Trulli is disqualified when an official spots 
him sneaking onto the Circle Line, while several of these fashion-conscious 
millionaires opt for a pit stop in Prada. But permit parking means we lose both 
Jordans and a Sauber to some aggressive clamping.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Now, to the roar of the 
grandstand, Michael Schumacher leads the remaining cars round Hyde Park Corner 
and flat out into Park Lane at a mind-blistering 35mph. BMW, Mercedes and the 
other luxury car showrooms have never seen so much custom in a single day. 
Regrettably, most of the people wanting test drives are pasty-skinned IT 
consultants dressed head to toe in the faded Ferrari team colours. Down they 
come to Marble Arch, past Speaker's Comer, and all they have to do to complete 
the circuit is nip down Lancaster Gate, fight through Netting Hill, down Holland 
Park, round the Thames Water Tower roundabout, edge down the A41M slip road, 
take a left on to the A40... from there it's just a three-hour crawl back to 
Hanger Lane.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>It may not be your average 
grand prix but that's driving in London for you. Only another 71 laps to 
go...</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2><FONT face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Eight Club members joined Tom Jones 
and his family in a packed church at Chingford for the funeral of his wife, 
Enid. At the family&#8217;s request the Club did not send flowers, but&nbsp;a donation 
to Cancer UK has been sent on the club&#8217;s behalf. A letter from Tom is shown 
later in this newsletter, and I know I speak for everyone when I say that we look 
forward to his return to club meetings when he is sufficiently mobile after his 
hip replacement.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We may be in the middle of summer 
but we have recently booked our Christmas Dinner; a change of venue this time to 
the Old Manor at Potters Bar. Despite this being almost on our doorstep, we have 
never eaten there, but Keith Oswick knew they had a separate room that could 
take our numbers. He and Dick Rogers took a drive from a club meeting back to 
Potters Bar and booked it straight away. The date is December 13th.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Hoddesdon Show on 12th July was 
a glorious day; nearly every year has been sunny for this event. The number of 
cars we had was lower this year but it is always a pleasant relaxing day. Keith 
and Audrey Williams always extend an invitation for tea and cakes afterwards but 
this year only Brian Kingsley and ourselves were able to take up the offer.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Classics on the Common meeting 
at Harpenden is still attracting more and more vehicles; around 2,000 this year 
(including an XJR9 in Silk Cut racing livery) with a similar number turned away. 
Considering this is held on a Wednesday evening, the variety of vehicles, 
ranging from the aforementioned XJR9 through every type of classic car and 
motorcycle and even an old double deck bus, is nothing short of amazing. This is 
really a meeting for petrolheads with, this year, even the main road lined with 
spectators all night just watching the vehicles drive by!

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On Monday 9th June, I went to the 
meeting of the SS jaguars on a lovely evening, having met up with Keith and 
Audrey, Brian K. and Richard Freestone at Chiswell Green just off the M25. They 
followed my car through the woods and down the lane to the Holly Bush at Potters 
Crouch, where we were made welcome by SS Register members. There was a good 
turnout of cars, four SSs, three E-types, one XK, two XJs , a Morgan and a 
Morris Minor. Thanks to fellow Area 57 members for coming along.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We went along to the show in our MK

sideshows, stalls and a fairground, plus Classic cars, lorrys and monster 
trucks. We went into the arena with the Whitewebbs Museum crowd. I even went on 
the Dodgems (they were fast ones!). A good time was had by all until my 
granddaughter ran out of money, so then we went home.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Once again superbly organized by 
Vicky, with a great mix of vehicles. Apart from the cars there was plenty to see 
and do, including a craft tent, funfair, various stalls, and a soccer skills 
competion hosted by former West Ham player Tony Cottee.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On Saturday there were 40 cars and 
several Triumph motorcycles. Club members Brian K., Len and Sally, Keith and 
Audrey, and Wayne all showed their cars. On Sunday, an even hotter day, there 
were 55 cars. A splendid turn out considering that the Bromley Pageant and 
Chigwell shows both clashed. Members attending were Brian K., John and Penny, 
Brian F. and Linda, and Wayne. Mick and Jaquie were also booked but due to 
various hoses leaking were unable to make it.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Voting slips were given out for 
various age groups and categories and Wayne&#8217;s superb 1967 Series 1, 2+2 E- type 
won the car that most people would like to go home in, and came runner up in his 
class, cars from 1961-1978, well done Wayne.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Car of the day was EDVVS member Tony 
Eldridge with his magnificent 1934 Austin 7, 2 seater. A really great day out 
for all the family, lovely weather, and well organized. Well done Vicky and her 
team of road safety girls. Finally a mention for the marshals, Graham, Wayne and 
Isle of Wight Mick who got all the cars parked safely, we couldn&#8217;t have done it 
without you!

LONDON?</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">From Motoring 
press</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Now classics are under threat from 
London authorities who want them banned from the city centre, with underlying 
implications for the rest of the country. A new study imminently due for 
publication contains plans that threaten to end the use of classic cars in 
London with possible implications nationwide. The study examines the possible 
implementation of so called "Low Emission Zones" (LEZs), that is areas in which 
vehicles with high emissions, possibly including cars built before 1992, the 
year when catalytic converters became compulsory on new cars in the UK, would be 
banned. The full report into LEZs, a joint project by the Association of London 
Governments (ALG) and the Greater London Authority (GLA), will be available 
within a matter of weeks. A spokesman for the ALG told CCW that the study is 
strictly at the "feasibility stage" but added that further steps to reduce 
pollution in the capital were "essential". Despite the fact that LEZs are not 
likely to appear in the very near future, if the policy were to be become 
official legislation, there would clearly be enormous implications for classic 
car owners in the capital and, having already brought in the unpopular 
congestion charge in the capital, London's Mayor, Ken Livingstone, has reputedly 
said that he is considering the adoption of LEZs in all 33 London boroughs. An 
additional fear is that other cities across the country might be prompted to 
follow suit reducing the use of classics in built up areas nationwide. At the 
time of going to press further details are unavailable, but we will bring you 
the full story as soon as the report is published.

<P align=justify>Yet another year has whizzed past full of events. Some were new 
venues for us but there were still quite a few familiar ones, and along the way 
we made some new friends.</P></B></FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>
<P align=justify>Once again the Enfield Pageant was the highlight of our year, 
with the usual hard work being put in by many of our area members, and my thanks 
go out to so many of you for your support. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>We had two excellent breakfast runs, and by the numbers that 
attend these two events at the times of year when the weather can be so unkind 
shows just how much they are enjoyed. </P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>The Christmas Dinner, again well supported, and for the second 
time in our history actually held in Enfield, took place in the Conservatory of 
the Plough in Crews Hill, with a real Christmas atmosphere. Unfortunately there 
were a few absent friends, which meant a distinct lack of gadgets and 
gimmicks.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>These events don&#8217;t just happen, it takes a lot of hard work to 
organise and make them successful, so my thanks go to everyone who gives a 
helping hand.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Spare a thought also for our newsletter editor, and while 
you&#8217;re sitting at home on these long dark dreary nights, why not put pen to 
paper and write a report on an event that you went to in the summer so that 
Wendy doesn&#8217;t have to think of every item of news.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Our thoughts at this time reach out to both Eric and Margot, 
and Tom and Enid in what are undoubtedly difficult times for them and we hope 
that the New Year sees better things in store.</P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>And finally, my personal thanks to all of you for your 
continued help and support over the past year.</P>
<P align=justify></P></FONT><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>
<P align=justify>I WISH YOU ALL A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A SAFE JOURNEY INTO 
THE NEW YEAR.</P></FONT><FONT face=Calligrapher size=6>

<P align=justify></B></FONT><FONT size=3>As last year, our Christmas Dinner was 
at The Plough, and thirty seven of us were there to enjoy a pleasant evening. 
I&#8217;ve had favourable comments on the evening and if the noise level is any 
indication of enjoyment, it was a success. Last year&#8217;s had seemed a little 
subdued, compared to some of our Christmas meals but this seemed to go well. 
Thanks to Barbara for organising it, as usual.

<P align=justify><FONT size=3>If anyone needs to blow away some cobwebs, 
hangovers etc. on New Year&#8217;s Day, the Bentley and Vintage Car Clubs will be 
having their traditional meet at Shenley. The pub is different this year; they 
now meet at The White Horse, 37 London Road, Shenley. There is usually a good 
collection of cars with our Jaguars often being the youngsters.

<P align=justify><FONT size=3>It has been suggested that we make up a party to 
go Ten Pin Bowling in the New Year. The nearest centre to the Legion is the 
David Lloyd Centre in Carterhatch Lane. They apparently have plans to scrap 
their lanes in order to build tennis courts, so if we want to do this, we&#8217;ll 
have to make a booking for sometime in January. Maybe we can get some names 
together on 6th January meeting and arrange it.

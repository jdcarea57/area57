<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The weeks since the Enfield Pageant 
of Motoring have rushed by, so in case any of you don&#8217;t know, we again had a 
very succesful event. On the Sunday thirty four of our cars were on show and 
twenty six on the Monday. Our club funds have been boosted by £150 second prize 
money. I gather that it was a bumper weekend for both entrants and visitors, 
helped by good weather without being excessively hot. Thanks to everyone who 
displayed their cars but particularly to Eric for organising all the booking, 
distributing passes and bearing the main brunt of getting the cars moved around 
to their best effect. John Wilkinson again mowed our plot for us, which this 
year was enhanced by two large planted pot displays. These came to us courtesy 
of Clock House Nursery via Keith Oswick&#8217;s son. The nursery didn&#8217;t even want 
their name displayed as sponsor and suggested we auction them for charity. Alan 
and Barbara bought them and gave Dick a contribution to Martin&#8217;s day centre. 
Everybody appreciates the cooking team&#8217;s efforts to get the mornings off to a 
good start with bacon rolls. The majority of people pull their weight to make 
our display the success that it is. We have decided to pension off our club tent 
which has served us well for several years and we have now bought a green and 
white one which can be erected quickly and has the advantage of optional 
detachable side walls.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Brian Kingsley was our sole 
representative at the Back to The Seventies show at Waltham Cross on June 7th, 
and managed to get his picture in the local paper.....with a caption that could 
lead to him being known from now on as "Sleek Brian". Only eight cars were on 
display, but the narrow age requirement of just one decade does seem rather 
limiting.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">After a gap of six years, the XK 
Register returned to the Brooklands Museum for XK Day. It is a venue that seems 
to attract a substantial number of cars; the most that we have seen at XK Day 
for several years. For those not familiar with Brookland, one of it&#8217;s features 
is a test slope which was built in 1909 as a means of testing brakes. The gentle 
slope of 1:8 rapidly goes to 1:4 by the top and the sound of a D-type replica 
going up was pretty impressive. With Dick and Eileen we had travelled down on 
Saturday morning to meet up with quite a few other cars which were going to take 
part in a scenic run. This had been organised by Nick Pearce who writes the XK 
News for the Jaguar Driver. His directions were very clear and we all enjoyed a 
round trip of about seventy five miles around the Surrey countryside with a 
lunch stop at a vineyard just outside Dorking. The pleasant evening was added to 
by a magician who went from table to table, performing baffling tricks right 
under our noses.

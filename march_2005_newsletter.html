Minutes of the 19th A.G.M</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Twenty three members were 
present at the A.G.M., just one less than last year. Alan Collins as Area Rep 
thanked everyone for coming and it was agreed that the Minutes of last year’s 
meeting should be taken as read. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Alan gave us a quick reminder 
of some of the events and social occasions that various members went to 
throughout the year. The Enfield Pageant was very successful with the area 
winning the first prize of £250 for Best Club Stand. Alan thanked Eric Tetsell 
for his organisation, John Wilkinson and Keith Oswick for mowing the plot and 
providing floral decoration, plus any girls involved in cooking duties. As far 
as car events are concerned, the main ones that need mentioning are Harpenden 
and Croxley Green, with the former attracting 2000 vehicles. Other places 
visited were the Maldon Museum of Power, Redbridge, Hoddesdon, Buntingford, 
Trent Park, Shendish Manor, Nazeing and Shenley. The Ace Cafe has become a 
regular venue for Dick Rogers and Eric Tetsell, and Keith &amp; Audrey Williams 
have enjoyed a couple of weekends organised by the EDVVS. There were two XK 
weekends, one at Hailsham, the other at Stamford. The September Area weekend at 
Corse Lawn near Tewkesbury was very successful. Thanks to Dick and Eric for 
organising the visit to the Standon Transport Museum and the pub lunch nearby. 
Another very enjoyable outing was the trip to Southend on the paddle steamer 
"Waverly"; our thanks to Keith O for organising this one for us.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had three Breakfast Runs 
this year; the two regular ones to Rickling Green plus a summer one (when it 
rained) to the Red House near Royston. For the second year we enjoyed a 
Christmas Dinner at the Old Manor, Potters Bar.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Alan said that he was pleased 
to see that Doug, Ron, Pam, Brian and Karen are all healthy again after having 
hospital treatment for various problems. He closed his Area Rep’s report by 
thanking everyone for their support and friendship which keeps the Area going. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Barbara Collins circulated 
the statement of Accounts which shows a continued healthy balance which has 
benefited from our £250 prize at the Pageant. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Wendy Shipman thanked Roy 
&amp; Kim Fludgate for their continued production of the Newsletter, whether you 
receive it by post or E-mail. She also thanked Phil Kendon for putting her 
contributions to the Jaguar Driver magazine. As usual she requested more 
contributions from members and was appreciative of those who do submit articles. 

<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Roy Fludgate told us that 
three memberships have lapsed but we have gained two, and currently we have 
forty one memberships, representing sixty people and sixty eight vehicles. He 
reminded members that the Area website is updated regularly so check for updates 
to the club calendar during the month, rather than waiting for the Newsletter. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There were no volunteers for 
any of the official posts and Alan and Barbara Collins, Wendy Shipman and Roy 
Fludgate have all agreed to continue as before. Phil Kendon will continue as 
Club Archivist but other commitments mean that he cannot always attend venues so 
is grateful for photos (with venue and date, please). 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There was one item for 
discussion under Any Other Business. It had been agreed last year that any 
memberships received after the end of February would incur a £5 rejoining fee as 
by this time, Barbara has banked subscriptions and Roy compiled membership 
lists, so considerable inconvenience is caused by late renewals. Despite plenty 
of reminders, one member sent in a late renewal and was annoyed to have his 
cheque returned with a request for the extra £5. This was fully discussed as the 
renewal was only a few days late but a vote of twenty in favour, and three 
against made it clear that the membership felt that the rule should be upheld. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It was then time for Valerie 
Dyall to present the John Dyall Trophy for service to the Club throughout the 
year. The recipient this year was Dick Rogers. Well deserved. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Usually, founder member and 
first Area Rep. Chris Engeham proposes a vote of thanks to Alan and team but he 
was unable to attend this year, however he did send a letter which was passed 
around at the meeting, and is also reproduced below.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><STRONG>Letter from Chris 
Engeham:</STRONG></FONT></U></P>
<P align=justify><U></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000 size=2>Dear 
Alan &amp; Barbara</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000 size=2>Another AGM, 
doesn't time fly these days.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000 size=2>As you know I 
am not currently active in any Jaguar activities, no longer owning any Jaguar 
cars, but still maintain very fond interest in all classic Jaguar matters, the 
JDC and Area 57. It gives me great pleasure to know that there are so many 
members still enjoying their cars and the social side that has always been 
second to none at "57".</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000 size=2>In case I can't 
get to the meeting next Monday can you pass on my warmest regards to all my 
friends, including yourselves of course, and wish Area 57 another exciting 
motoring year.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000 size=2>Keep up the 
good work Alan and many thanks to you, Barbara, Wendy and Roy and the many 
others that contribute to the running and keeping alive the club that has given 
me and so many others a lot of very good times and memories, and all done 
without the usual club politics and in fighting that you hear of in other clubs. 
I think Brian K summed it up well when he said it is like having an extra family 
around you.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000 size=2>With very best 
regards</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Brush Script MT" color=#000000 size=6>Chris 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Alan then re-iterated his 
earlier thanks to everyone for their support and friendship, and the A.G.M. was 
then closed. 
<HR>

<HR>

<P></P></FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>With the A.G.M. concluded we 
then began the usual meeting, which mainly consisted of new dates for the 
calendar. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Luton Festival of 
Transport, which Eric has visited in the past and can recommend is on 12th June. 

<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Classics on the Common 
meeting at Harpenden is on Wednesday 27th July and as last year, is only open to 
pre-booked vehicles. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There are two events at 
Croxley Green; Wednesday 3rd August and Sunday 18th September, although the 
first of these dates clashes with a Jaguar evening at the Ace Cafe. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I have been sent three dates 
from the Broxbourne Council; Rock ‘n Roll Day at Waltham Cross on Saturday 11th 
June. The same venue on Saturday 6th August is Back to the 60’s. The usual 
Vintage and Classic Car display at Hoddesdon is on Saturday 9th July. Details of 
any of these events are available from Karen Thurgood (01992-785555 ext 5716). 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Barbara has started 
collecting names and money for the first of our Breakfast Runs on Sunday 24th 
April. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Hopefully at the next meeting 
it will be decided whether there is enough interest in visiting the Shuttleworth 
Collection for their Military Pageant Display on 5th June. A reminder that they 
are unable to give a group reduction on price, so the normal £15 applies which 
would have to be paid two or three weeks in advance. If you are interested but 
won’t be at next month’s meeting, give either Alan or myself a ring. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It has been proposed that we 
could hold the Christmas Dinner at the Pearse House Hotel, Bishops Stortford. 
This is where Alan works, and we would be able to have a room to ourselves for 
the evening. The only Saturdays in December available are the 3rd or the 17th. 
Alan would like to get a rapid decision in order to place the booking.

<P align=justify><I></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Brian, John and 
Loraine and ourselves went to Saffron Waldon Town Hall to support Alan’s 
operatic Society. This was the best production by this company so far - with 
Alan taking one of the leading roles.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The costumes, scenery and 
whole performance (don’t mention the wig!) were superb.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We look forward to next 
year’s production - Oklahoma.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Unfortunately, zero out of 
ten for the chips. Everywhere had closed early!!

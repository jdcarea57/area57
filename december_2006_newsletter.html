<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><STRONG>This time last year I 
was sending you a report on all the 3’s. 3 major hospital operations, 3 major 
birthdays, 3 breakfast runs. Little did I know that there would be more 3’s in 
stock for this year, and I would be at the centre of them. First the accident, 
then the stroke, and just to round it off, a big dose of septicaemia, so believe 
it or not, I personally will be very glad to see the back of 2006.</STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG>I would just like to say a big ‘Thank You’ to you all 
for your very kind wishes throughout this, and the support you gave to 
Barb.</STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG>As you all know, I’m fit and well again, (despite 
Saturday 2nd December) and am looking forward to a fresh new year.</STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG>A club like ours cannot survive 20 years without the 
support of its membership, and because of this we have continued to grow. We may 
have had a number of disappointments because of the weather this year, but some 
new shows have helped us to see new places and new faces.</STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG>Let’s keep our fingers crossed for 2007 and see if we 
can get back to some good sunshine and be able to enjoy our hobby even 
more.</STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG>Let me just say again a great big ‘Thank You’ for your 
support and help over the past year, and here’s hoping for a bright new healthy 
2007.</STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG>Wishing you a very Merry 
Christmas.</STRONG></P></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2>

<P align=justify></FONT><FONT color=#0000ff>This is something of a milestone, as 
in all the time that Roy, Kim and I have been producing the Newsletter this will 
be the first time that Kim hasn't had to decifer my handwriting first, as we 
have arrived in the world of E mail at last.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff>On Saturday 2nd December just over thirty 
of us enjoyed a very good evening at Pearse House where we held our Christmas 
Dinner for the second year. No dressing up this time, but Eric &amp;Margot had 
organised a sing song of well known Christmas songs. It was without doubt a 
successful occasion; good food, good company in pleasant surroundings and, on 
one particular table , wine was flowing well !!!!!

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff>There will be two chances to use the cars 
over the holiday period; the EDVVS will make their usual run to The Sun at 
Nazeing on Wednesday 27th December, and the Bentley and Vintage Sports Car Club 
will meet at The Pre Hotel near St Albans towards Redbourn, on New Year's Day at 
around mid day. Last year there was a very good selection of vehicles so well 
worth a drive out if you need to get rid of some cobwebs.

Year'sDay some of us will be there as usual

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It seems a long while since I 
wrote the December Newsletter, as it has to be written earlier in the month in 
order to reach you by post before Christmas. Since then we have had the 
traditional Mince Pie Night which, most surprisingly, wasn&#8217;t as well attended as 
usual. In fact not all the food got eaten , which must be a first. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On the day after Boxing Day a 
few of our members travelled to Nazeing to join up with the EDVVS for their 
usual post-Christmas Run, and on New Year&#8217;s Day I understand that there was 
quite a good turnout of cars at the Bentley meeting at Shenley, in spite of the 
extremely wet weather.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It&#8217;s time to get your diaries 
out and start entering some dates for the coming year. Our AGM will be on March 
17th. As usual, if you have any matters that you would like discussed please 
speak to Alan Collins beforehand. Likewise, if anyone wants to take over any of 
the regular jobs, again speak to Alan. He will be unable to attend any meetings 
before the AGM, so please ring him&nbsp;if you wish to raise any points about 
the club and how it is run.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Barbara has booked the 
Breakfast Runs to the Cricketers at Rickling Green for Sunday April 27th and 
Sunday October 5th. In Barbara&#8217;s absence I have started taking names and 
payments for these.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On Sunday May 4th there is a 
Rotary Club show at Hartham Common near Hertford. It is officially for vehicles 
over 25 years old, but Alan intends to find out if we can put on a club display 
in which more recent vehicles can be included. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On the following day, Bank 
Holiday Monday, it is track day at Goodwood; Alan has details of this, but I 
believe they are also usually in the Jaguar Driver. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Other dates I have been given 
are; the Rotary Club Show at Chigwell on 29th June, which Mick &amp; Jaquie 
always recommend, and The Darling Buds of May show in Kent is on July 13th. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Looking further ahead to 
September, Dick Rogers has been sent details of a show on the 14th at the 
Institute of the Motor Industry near Hertford. This is in aid of the Ataxia 
Rehabilitation Unit at Rayleigh, which helps neurological childhood diseases. 
The show will be held in the grounds of the I.M.I., with space for about 100 
vehicles. Although food and drink will be available, there will not be any other 
entertainment. All vehicles displayed will receive a plaque, and a prize will be 
awarded for the best kept vehicle.

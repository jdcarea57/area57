<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On Sunday 25th April we had our 
first Breakfast Run to the Cricketers at Rickling Green since the new owner took 
over. Everything went smoothly, although some felt that the bacon could have 
been better. For only the second time since the Breakfast Runs started, the two 
groups, starting from Enfield and Chingford met up at a roundabout just outside 
Bishops Stortford, and all arrived at the pub in convoy. It was a nice morning 
so we were able to enjoy tea, coffee etc. in Alan and Barbara&#8217;s garden 
afterwards.

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">XK SPRING WEEKEND - 7th to 
10th May</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The area this year was the Sussex 
Weald, based at a hotel just outside Hailsham. It was the greyest weekend we 
have had, but as the rain was all overnight we couldn&#8217;t complain. As usual the 
majority of people were regulars but it is always good to see a few new faces 
and two of the first time couples fitted in very well.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On Saturday morning we had a short 
drive to the Bentley Wildfowl Trust which also has a small motor museum. Most of 
the vehicles are privately owned and there is a great range there. Apart from 
children&#8217;s pedal cars they ranged in size from a Sinclair C5 to huge American 
cars. The two curators were very enthusiastic and were more than happy to let 
people through the ropes to get a good look. They lifted bonnets, started 
engines and couldn&#8217;t have been more helpful. We had a very pleasant wander 
around the lakes and pools that are home to hundreds of ducks, geese and swans, 
plus flamingos and cranes. Unfortunately the future of the Wild Fowl Centre and 
the Museum is uncertain at the moment as it seems as though the County Council 
wants to sell it.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Our arranged afternoon visit was to 
the Hidden Springs Vineyard a few miles away. We made a lunch time stop at a 
village pub on the way, which turned out to be a mistake. Terrible service and 
some of the food wasn&#8217;t up to much at all. Doug and Eileen reckoned they could 
have soled their shoes with their omelettes! We eventually arrived about half 
hour late for the wine tasting but we weren&#8217;t the only ones.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Sunday morning was an even shorter 
drive to Michelham Priory, a very peaceful and picturesque place. The building 
which was once an Augustinian Priory is surrounded by the largest water filled 
mediaeval moat in England. Along with attractive gardens there is also a working 
watermill, which was the backdrop for a performance by some morris 
dancers.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Back to the hotel for lunch, which 
we seemed to have to wait a long time for but the reason appeared to be staffing 
problems. The kitchen door suddenly opened and a girl shouted out that there 
were cockroaches in the kitchen and we would all get food poisoning. This was 
her revenge for being sacked, along with her brother (one of the chefs) when he 
was caught stealing about £50 worth of steak! It happened to be Eileen&#8217;s 
birthday and Eric and Margot had arranged for a cake to be presented to her at 
the table.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The majority of people headed home 
in various directions after Sunday lunch but the six of us along with about ten 
others were staying on an extra night. With some time to kill on Monday morning 
before hitting the M25 we visited a llama breeding centre before lunch in 
Hartfield (Winnie the Pooh territory) at a very good pub this time. We always 
enjoy these weekends but it was nice to have a much shorter journey than the 
last two years to Dartmoor and N. Yorkshire.

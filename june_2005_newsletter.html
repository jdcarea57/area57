<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">If there is anyone who hasn’t heard, 
we were placed second at the Enfield Pageant Of Motoring. This year the 
excellent M.G. Owners Club stand pipped us. On both days we had a really good 
display which Eric had organised again for us. As usual, the bacon rolls were 
appreciated. The Pageant is the event that really calls for a lot of team work 
with organisation, transportation etc. and at the next meeting Alan thanked 
everyone who had been involved. In addition, Alan received a letter from the 
EDVVT thanking us for our assistance with marshalling at the show.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Brian and Linda surprised most of us 
by bringing along their wedding photos from a few days earlier. Congratulations 
to the new Mr and Mrs Ferrett from us all.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Needless to say, our club calendar 
as well as the one in the Jaguar Driver have plenty of events for you to go to. 
Don’t forget that a write up, however short, is appreciated.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It seems that 18th September is a 
popular date. The Croxley Green show is already in the calendar and it now 
appears that the St. Mary’s School classic car show in Bishops Stortford and the 
show at Fanshaws are also on that date. Brian Kingsley has entry forms for the 
latter which is at The Institute of the Motor Industry at Brickenden.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, Keith and Audrey have 
asked me to pass on their usual invitation for a cuppa after the Hoddesdon show 
on July 9th.

<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On what should have 
been a blazing June day (actually it wasn't too bad and stayed dry but with a 
cold wind), Tom, Brian, Dick &amp; Eileen &amp; Martin, and myself attended a 
classic car event in Waltham Cross on Saturday 11th. There were 24 cars booked 
in but unfortunately only 12 turned up (of which 4 were from our club!). The 
remainder, though, formed a good mixture including a couple of American 
gas-guzzlers, an Austin-Healey 3000 and a beautiful 1930s Allard.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The highlight of the day was a live 
band (The Morebeats Blues Band) who got the town rocking with their rendition of 
numbers from the Beatles, Stones , Eric Clapton and Fleetwood Mac to name but a 
few. They were later accompanied by a dance troop called Just Jivin' who 
encouraged the passers by to have a dance or two! (Incidentally they hold their 
dance club night in the British Legion on Holtwhites Hill on a Thursday - for 
those who might wish to freshen up on their jiving technique! </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">In contrast, the most exciting part 
of the day was Dick administering first aid to a lady who decided to have an 
epileptic fit right in front of his car.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">All in all an enjoyable day but not 
a lot to do in Waltham X and no prizes or judging of cars.

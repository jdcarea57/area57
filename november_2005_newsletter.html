<DIV><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Well over thirty of us joined Tom Jones 
and his family and friends to celebrate his 80th birthday recently. It was nice 
to meet up with some of our less regular members on what was a very pleasant 
afternoon.

</FONT></DIV>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We are still talking about 
our twentieth celebrations next year. Another suggestion has been the 
Elizabethan banquet at Hatfield House. It doesn’t look as though a train trip is 
viable as they are all on week days.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Jaguar Drivers’ Club is 
thirty years ahead of us and their 50th celebrations are centred at Heythrop 
Park near Banbury and Chipping Norton on 20th/21st May weekend. It has been 
several years since we have been to a big J.D.C. event as a club, so it might be 
worth attending on the Sunday to mark both anniversaries. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the last meeting we 
discussed the possibility of having an occasional guest speaker at our meetings. 
While this is something to be welcomed in theory, there are a few problems. The 
first is our venue; while the main bar at the Legion is ideal for our usual 
meetings, the presence of other Legion members would make it impractical for a 
talk. The large room upstairs is usually available but in the winter is rather 
chilly and unwelcoming and, with the numbers we usually get, we tend to rattle 
around a bit up there. It’s also not feasible to relocate to the Whitewebbs 
Museum for any such occasion, as we are advertised as holding meetings at the 
Legion on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month. Richard knows someone who might 
be prepared to run a car film show on some occasion. It is a subject that we 
need to look into further but as always any suggestions to improve the club are 
always welcome.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

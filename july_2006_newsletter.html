size=3><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It seems ironic that in a year which 
saw the Pageant cancelled due to a fairly isolated wet spell, there has been 
plenty of sunshine ever since. 
<HR>
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On 8th July, quite a few of 
us were at the Hoddesdon Show and this maintained its reputation for good 
weather, also enabling us to enjoy a cuppa at Keith and Audrey’s afterwards. At 
the show Dick’s MK V was chosen as the Car of the Day. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A couple of days later we 
joined Dick at the SS meeting at Potters Crouch. Despite one of the few wet 
evenings we had three E-types, a Daimler Double Six, a Daimler 250 and an XK 
150. Unfortunately, Nik Drukker’s MK IV was the only one of their cars there. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Our second Breakfast Run of 
the season on 16th July was also our second visit to the Woodman at 
Nuthampstead. Like last year, it was a lovely sunny morning and fourteen of our 
cars made a good display in the car park. Just over two dozen of us enjoyed an 
excellent breakfast. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We have made arrangements 
with the MG Club that meets at the Botany Bay Cricket Club, just off Enfield 
Ridgeway, to join them on the evening of our second August club meeting (Monday 
21st). We will meet at the Legion as usual and then drive there together, 
hopefully leaving by about 8 p.m. They have said that they will put on a BBQ so 
obviously need to know how many of us will be there. Please let Alan know at 
least a week beforehand so that we can finalise things with them. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>People who have attended the 
Buntingford Show may have received entry forms for this year’s event, which will 
take place on Saturday 2nd September. Alan has some spare forms if they are 
needed. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Roy and Kim’s eldest 
daughter, Emma, was the first Area 57 baby to be born after the formation of the 
club, and it was an indication of how the years have gone by, when Roy told us 
that she has just passed her driving test at the first attempt. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A welcome addition to the 
assembled cars at the last meeting was the 1993 XJS 6 litre brought along by new 
member Michael Benjamin. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Some of you will know that 
for the past few months, Dick and Eric have been having a potato growing 
competition, leading to plenty of friendly rivalry not to say some cheating. The 
result is the occasion which Audrey has written about for me, (see below). 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I have started a new Balmoral 
order, so if anyone is in need of sweatshirts, polo shirts etc. please let me 
know. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I am writing this on what is 
predicted to be a day of record breaking temperature and I am now going to 
mention Christmas. Alan has made a provisional booking at Pearse House again, as 
it was well liked at Christmas last year and also for our 20th party in March. 
The date is December 2nd. Unfortunately we can’t have the whole place to 
ourselves as we did last year, but we would be in a separate room from the other 
group which already has a booking. If you have any problems with this 
arrangement, then please let Alan know. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Several of us are members of 
the EDVVS and more are involved indirectly by displaying at the Pageant, 
(usually) which raises money for the continuing work at the Museum. Keith Oswick 
has kindly given me this account of how work is progressing.

PROJECT</FONT></U></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>This building 
conception has been talked about for many years at the EDVVS Club. Some people 
wanted a new clubhouse built to hold the meetings etc. with a fire station 
attached so the existing meeting room could be used as more Museum space. It was 
decided in the end to have a covered display area plus a fire station so the 
wheels were set in motion.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>While some of you went to the 
SS Meeting at St. Albans this clashed with the meeting at the Museum where the 
committee updated the members on the progress so far.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Steve Brayshaw opened the 
meeting thanking Mike Pierce and Danny Smith for their previous input to this 
project. Then the meeting was handed over to Paul Wallace who has taken over the 
role of co-ordinating present and future works to the building, with Keith 
Childs, the full time worker at the Museum, as Project Manager, because he is on 
site every day to deal with day to day problems as they arise. Paul W. gave the 
background to the quotes and estimates that were required. Enfield Council 
planners finally agreed the type of brick we could use which just happened to be 
the one that was chosen a couple of years ago! They are hand made imperial 
Swanage Red sourced from E.H..Smiths of Bovingdon supplied by IDStock at a 
quoted price of £1400 a thousand, however, after a little bartering 20,000 
bricks were supplied at a cost of £530 a thousand, so many thanks go to the 
people involved in that transaction. The building company we are now using is 
Oakland Refurbishing Ltd. of Stevenage who are making a very nice job of laying 
the bricks and blocks. They were helped, of course, by the good work done 
previously by Richard Rogers on footings and brickwork up to damp course level. 
The cost of brickworks above dampcourse is quoted as £26,860 labour only. To 
compliment the brickwork there will be a Portland stone porch and portico with 
signage to the fire station display area entrance, matching the front of the 
existing building, supplied and installed at the beginning of August at a cost 
of £26,000. There will also be a Victorian dial clock mounted above the 
stonework centre of the fire station entrance, which will be fitted with 14ft 
high wooden bi-fold doors still to be quoted for. At the moment the dial clock 
is being renovated by Phil Chard whose trade is clock repairs and who is also 
club treasurer. I believe the clock came from a building in the Winchmore Hill 
area. The side display area will have a stone portico with porchway to match the 
existing museum building, with up and over doors either side to maximise the 
access to the display area. The works are now proceeding at a steady rate with 
completion of building works due by the end of September. Total amount spent to 
date on this part of the project is £53,990 with an expected £68,000 to 
complete. A question from the floor of the meeting was about another floor to be 
added to fire station, but the answer was that this was not practical.&nbsp; 
John Wilkinson had the tedious task of scaling down the area, the vehicles the 
club has to put in the new building, the requirements of a disabled person’s 
lift, fire lobby and exit would encroach on floor space so would not allow 
enough room for fire engine display etc. Plus the auto-jumble shop would have to 
be reduced by 6ft to allow for an external fire escape to be fitted. There were 
no more questions from the floor so Steve closed this part of the meeting asking 
members to show their appreciation to Paul Wallace and a number of members in 
the background who did not get a mention who have been constructive to this 
project.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>If any member would like to 
view what’s going on with the building project etc. the museum is open every 
Tuesday 10 am - 4 pm or Paul W. said we can call in and speak to Keith Childs, 
John Wilkinson or Mick Barker during the week, the invitation is there so use 
it. EDVVS needs your continual support.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Club has a few thousand 
programmes left over from the Enfield Pageant; it contains a calendar and 
adverts from companies and it was suggested that flyers for Trent Park Show and 
the Whitewebbs Museum were inserted and members were asked to take 25 copies to 
give to neighbours and friends to save wasting them.

Gala Event - Sunday 9th July 2006</FONT></P></B></U>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The morning started at 11 am 
at the first venue in Orchard Close, Cuffley. The Judge (KW) and participants 
(ET &amp; RR) plus several witnesses took up their places on the grassy slopes 
of Eric’s garden. 5 bines were dug up and the potatoes were dutifully placed in 
the agreed receptacle. (Eric’s old black bucket!) It was noted this competitor 
had already been awarded a gold medal at Chelsea Flower Show for his giant 
(potato) specimen!! There was photographic evidence on display to prove it! 
After the ceremonial first dig celebratory champagne was served in the 
conservatory we then followed in convoy to Clay Hill allotments. Again the 
digging procedure was the same. Both potato harvests were transported by Keith 
O. to ensure no misdemeanor took place.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At Churchbury Road the 
specimens were duly weighed and measured. The judge awarded points up to a total 
of 30 - according to various categories and criteria. The marking sheets were 
filled in and it was announced Eric was the overall winner. We celebrated with a 
refreshing Pimms on the lawn. Certificates were presented to both parties with a 
comprehensive recipe book on potatoes to the winner. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Eileen as always provided 
refreshments whilst Margot recorded highlights of the event on video. 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A thoroughly enjoyable event. 
Many thanks to everyone involved. Next year we hope to expand the event making 
it open to whoever may wish to enter.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It was suggested that we 
might make it into a sponsored competition and to give the proceeds to 
charity.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We look forward to "Spuds - 
U- Judge" 
2007.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

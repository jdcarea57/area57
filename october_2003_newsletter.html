<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There is a possibility that 
this will be the last report of a Breakfast Run to Rickling Green as Barbara was 
told by his son Sean, that Tim Proctor has received a very good offer for The 
Cricketers. No doubt we will find out more in the New Year but there is no doubt 
that our Breakfast Runs will continue to another, as yet unknown, venue if 
necessary. On October 5th, the good weather that we have enjoyed for so long, 
continued and we had a lovely sunny morning; a bit cold for some people! Several 
people have commented on how nice the breakfast was this time and also how 
promptly everything was served. As usual several of us returned to Alan and 
Barbara&#8217;s to drink more tea and coffee and eat cake and biscuits.

<P align=justify>Report by Audrey Williams</B></I> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Once again a superb weekend 
organised by Whitewebbs Museum. We travelled to Alfriston (near Eastbourne) in 
brilliant sunshine on Friday afternoon. Parked in the reserved area set aside 
especially for the Club, checked in and had enough time to explore the village 
and shops &amp; visit a tea-room before it got dark. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Saturday was another glorious 
but cold day after a heavy frost. We travelled in convoy (20+ vehicles) to 
Bentley wildfowl and motor museum. A colleague from Whitewebbs accompanied us on 
our tour around the extensive wildfowl collection. Luckily Chas was very 
knowledgable about the various swans, ducks &amp; geese from all over the world 
so it made it particularly interesting for us. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The motor museum was an 
incredible private collection of rare cars including a :- </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>1909 Alldays &amp; Onions 
10/12 HP, 1937 Bentley James Young (with cantilever doors) ,1906 Brasier 5 
seater tourer, 1904 Darracq, 1903 De Dion Bouton, 1928 Minerva Type AK 32/34 HP, 
and a 1965 Trabant </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>All amazing ! </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had the afternoon to 
ourselves so Keith and I had a look around Eastbourne and Beachy Head. On the 
Sunday we visited Filching Manor &amp; motor museum. The Manor House built in 
1450 was very beautiful, but the museum was more of a huge workshop, with 
several vehicles in various stages of restoration. It was interesting to see two 
veteran cars being prepared for the London to Brighton run on Sunday November 
2nd. Malcolm Campbell's Bluebird K3 was also on display. Sadly the family who 
owned Filching had only the previous week lost their father, so it was purely 
the family's kindness in honouring their booking that made our visit 
possible.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As on previous occasions 
there was a quiz after the meal in the evenings. The topic this time was 
Football. Keith and I surprised ourselves by only having two missing answers out 
of 50! - as we know very little about sport (it must have been easy!) Don't be 
surprised to find the questions recycled for one of our Club's weekends away!!

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As there is very little to 
write about this month, I am taking the opportunity to include an article about 
nostalgia that will ring true to lots of you. It was passed to me by someone who 
found it on the Internet and I have heard a similar version on the radio, so it 
may be familiar to some of you already.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>According 
to today&#8217;s regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 50's, 
60's, and 70's probably shouldn't have survived.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Our baby 
cots were covered with brightly coloured lead-based paint which was promptly 
chewed and licked.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had no 
childproof lids on medicine bottles, or latches on doors or cabinets and it was 
fine to play with pans.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>When we 
rode our bikes, we wore no helmets, just flip flops and fluorescent 'clackers' 
on our wheels.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As 
children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding in the 
passenger seat was a treat.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We drank 
water from the garden hose and not from a bottle - tasted the 
same.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We ate 
dripping sandwiches, bread and butter pudding and drank fizzy pop with sugar in 
it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing and not 
sitting in front of a computer/Playstation.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We shared 
one drink with four friends, from one bottle or can and no one actually died 
from this.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We would 
spend hours building go-carts out of scraps and then went top speed down the 
hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into stinging nettles 
a few times, we learned to solve the problem.<BR>We would leave home in the 
morning and play all day, as long as we were back before it got dark. No one was 
able to reach us all day and no one minded.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We did not 
have Playstations or X-Boxes, no video games at all. No 99 channels on TV, no 
videotape movies, no surround sound, no mobile phones, no personal computers, no 
Internet chat rooms. We had friends - we went outside and found 
them.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We played 
conkers and street rounders, and sometimes that ball really 
hurt.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We fell out 
of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits. They 
were accidents. We learnt not to do the same thing again.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had 
fights, punched each other hard and got black and blue - we learned to get over 
it.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We walked 
to friend's homes.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We made up 
games with sticks and tennis balls and ate live stuff, and although we were told 
it would happen, we did not have very many eyes out, nor did the live stuff live 
inside us forever.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We rode 
bikes in packs of 7 and wore our coats by only the hood.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Our actions 
were our own. Consequences were expected.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The idea of 
a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided 
with the law. Imagine that!</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>This 
generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and 
inventors, ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new 
ideas.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had 
freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it 
all.</FONT></EM></P>
<P align=justify><EM><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>And you're 
one of them. Congratulations!</FONT></EM></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><EM>We have had the luck to 
grow up as real kids, before lawyers and government regulated our lives, 'for 
our own good 
'.</EM></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>With 
last month&#8217;s Newsletter, it was a case of the best laid plans of mice and men 
etc. My normal procedure is to write the Newsletter after the second meeting of 
the month. Last time I did it after the first May meeting, so that Roy and Kim 
would be able to send it out before the Pageant. So what happens? A postal 
strike! As a result, the first part was a bit irrelevant by the time it reached 
most people.</FONT></STRONG><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>For those of you who 
haven&#8217;t caught up with the news, the Pageant was a great success as we were 
chosen as the best club stand. This is the third time that we have won the £250 
first prize. After winning in 1995 and 1996 we decided to disqualify ourselves 
the following year as we were involved with the EDVVS in setting up a special 
display, and felt that this would give us an unfair advantage. We were placed 
second in 1998 and 1999 and then of course, the rain caused last year&#8217;s event to 
be cancelled, so it was nice to be back as winners. I know Eric has included an 
article this month, thanking everyone but he obviously hasn&#8217;t thanked himself. 
As he says it is a team effort but someone has to take overall control of 
organisation etc. which Eric has done for several years now and it is much 
appreciated.

i.e. Matching Green, Valentines Park, Hoddesdon and XJ Day at Duxford. No doubt 
people will sort out amongst theselves if they wish to go to any of these 
together. We will be at Hoddesdon but a few words for the newsletter about any 
of the others would be appreciated.

Weekend at Gaydon in Warwickshire on August 10th/11th. We have no plans to 
organise an Area Run although Chris Engeham (01707-876612) will probably be 
going. Anyone interested in taking part in an Area Run (£7 per car plus £8 per 
person) could contact other nearby Areas, such as Essex (Area 33) Chilterns 
(Area 23) or Bedford (Area 17) to see if they are doing anything.

size=2>In a previous Newsletter, I mentioned the new show on the August Bank 
Holiday weekend which the EDVVS is holding together with the Hertfordshire Heavy 
Horse Association. This will be a show along the same lines as the Pageant with 
Steam engines, commercial vehicles, classic cars, autojumble etc. plus the added 
attraction of displays by the gentle giants of the horse world. We have decided 
to put on a club display on Monday 27th August as this then enables our more 
modern cars to take part. Individual entries have to be pre-1969. It was agreed 
that we will use the club tent and provide bacon rolls, tea and coffee as at the 
Pageant. Again Eric has agreed to organise our booking for this show, so please 
let him have your name.

surgery to remove his appendix and all went well, and it seems that all of Alan 
Collins&#8217; thespian activities have led to him taking the good luck phrase "Break 
a leg!" too literally. Not quite that bad, but he has got his foot all strapped 
up after breaking a bone due to stepping down a kerb awkwardly. Needless to say, 
sympathetic club members want to know when he is auditioning for Long John 
Silver!

<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I have 
just read Mick Stubbings' item in the last newsletter about the cameras in cats 
eyes. If you think that's bad, read on:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Be 
aware of the new speed cameras which are being erected the complete length of 
the 'A' and 'M' roads. They are recognised by a tall blue coloured pole and a 
small aerial pole next to it. We may have a possible stay of execution, due to 
the privacy law up-holding these units from being switched on. At the moment it 
is being debated within Parliament.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" 
size=2>SPEEDCHECK SVDD or SPECS went on-line recently on the Ml, netting 4,300 
offenders in a single day. The system does not use instantaneous speed like the 
cameras we're all familiar with, instead measuring the average speed of every 
vehicle over a distance of about a mile. How? By reading your license plates and 
matching them up camera-to-camera. Kent and Leicestershire police are so 
impressed with it that systems are being erected in their enforcement areas too. 
This is a new system which has now entered service after successful trials on 
the Ml and M20 in the UK.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" 
size=2>SPEEDCHECK SVDD (Sureway Video Detection Device) is a system similar in 
concept to the GATSO, but with a new twist. SVDD deploys cameras at either end 
of a measured baseline, (up to 500 metres) to monitor vehicles 24 hours a day. 
Using machine vision, vehicle number plates are read, and the precise time of 
each observation recorded and as a vehicle passes the second camera, the number 
plate records are matched, and an average speed for the vehicle is calculated. 
If this is above the trigger speed, then the vehicle's identification is 
recorded along with it's speed. It is also flashed up on a huge illuminated sign 
further down the road to embarrass the driver into slowing down. When triggered, 
the detection technology used in these cameras automatically records the date, 
precise time, location and speed of the offending vehicle, along with a detailed 
image of the front of the vehicle, which clearly records the number plate, make, 
model, who is driving and the colour of the vehicle.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There 
are five overriding reasons for the habitual speeder to be afraid of this 
system. Or maybe there could be the implication of a sixth reason - what if 
she/he is not your full time wife or girlfriend/husband or 
boyfriend??</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>1. It 
works 24 hours a day.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>2. 
Needs no film.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>3. Uses 
no flash.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>4. Uses 
no radar - so, bad luck all those of you who think that radar detectors 
work.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>5. It's 
been proven to be over 99% accurate in almost all weather 
conditions.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It 
doesn't do spot-speed checking. A GATSO can only check the speed of a vehicle 
within a certain range, so the tactic most drivers use now is to slow down for 
the camera and then speed up again once past it. SPEEDCHECK measures average 
speed over a known distance, so if you do 60 mph under each camera (in a 60 mph 
area) and then speed up to 80 mph in between, your average speed is likely to be 
near 70 mph -10 mph over the limit imposed, you're nicked. SVDD say this means 
that the system can impose a far smoother flow of traffic, eliminating slow-fast 
driving that the GATSO cameras provoke. Because it's automated, the system is 
entirely self-sufficient. It is hooked up to the DVLA computers, and can 
automatically process the fines and send out notices in the 
post.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It's 
Big Brother. Don't believe for a moment that this technology will only be used 
to catch speeders. It can be used to keep track of where every single car in the 
country is at any given moment in time once the network of these things becomes 
broad enough.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Warning 
to M25 motorists - there are 60 new cameras that start operating on the M25 in 
the middle of June 2001. These are between the A3 and M40. They are digital and 
linked direct to a computer, use no film or flashgun. They can deal with 60,000 
tickets EVERY HOUR. The cameras are also, apparently, linked and can workout 
your average speed between them. So, if you speed up between them and slow down 
as you approach them, if your average speed is over the "legal limit" and no 
threshold, you may well get a ticket.</FONT></STRONG></P>

size=2><EM>A few weeks ago I received an E-mail via the web site from a George 
C. Corcoran in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,enquiring about the cost of a new Jaguar 
saloon in the UK in 1971. As luck would have it a small piece appeared in that 
month&#8217;s Jaguar Driver with just the right information, which I duly sent. In due 
course I received the following response , which I thought might be of 
interest.</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Hi 
Roy,</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Thank 
you for your reply. As I recall the exchange in 1971 was $2.40 to the 
pound.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A 
little background to my problem. I am writing a book called "The Gold Jaguar" - 
a fictionalized version of a true narcotic investigation in which I participated 
in 1971. I am a retired American Federal Investigator. I served 37 years as an 
American Federal Narcotic Agent and a United States Customs Special Agent. I was 
the Assistant Commissioner for Investigations in Washington, D.C.for twelve 
years. I had served as the American Customs Attache in The American Embassy, 
Paris, France twice - 1970 to 1973 and 1985 to 1990.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>In 
1971, I was assigned as The Customs Attache in liaison with The American Bureau 
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs - BNDD (The predecessor of The Drug Enforcement 
Administration- DEA) Offices in the United States Embassy in Paris, France. In 
August 1971, a Belgium informant advised us that he had been approached by 
narcotic traffickers in France to take a car with 100 kilos of heroin and 
smuggle the car from France to New York City, New York. This information was 
given to the British Customs Investigators and the French Police. A unique 
investigation was commenced by American and French Investigators to identify the 
heroin traffickers in the Marseille area of France and the United States. The 
case involved undercover work, surveillance and investigative techniques. The 
traffickers were identified, surveillance was conducted of the car in Marseille, 
the transportation of the car to Paris, then on a ferry to Southampton, England, 
onto the British vessel Queen Elizabeth 2 - and on to New York for delivery to 
American narcotic smugglers. A BNDD Agent and I participated in the 
investigation and boarded the QE2 in Southampton and sailed on it to New York 
where we were involved in the arrest of several people there and the seizure of 
a Jaguar automobile and 100 kilos of heroin. Several French traffickers were 
also arrested in France.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The 
Belgian informant had been instructed to purchase a British car and make 
reservations to take the car on a British ship to New York City. We helped him 
pick out the Jaguar in London. I do not have a record of what he paid for the 
car. I do recall the informant was given about $10,000 to buy the car. It was a 
large four door sedan - right hand drive - we could not obtain a left hand drive 
that was immediately available.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>( An 
amusing aside is that we choose the Jaguar for him to buy as opposed to some 
other make British automobile since we knew eventually the Jaguar would be 
seized for illegal transportation of drugs in the United States - and we thought 
it would be great to have a Jaguar to later put to use - Iater the car was 
forfeited and used officially in the U.S. It would have been eventually sold to 
the public at auction - maybe someone out there is still driving the Jaguar ) 
</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Thank 
you again,</FONT></STRONG></P>

good day,</FONT></STRONG></P>

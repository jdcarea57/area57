<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Outside many towns you can 
"Park and Ride"; at Alan and Barbara&#8217;s on 15th August it was more a case of "Eat 
and Ride". This was the third time that we have had one of these gatherings to 
enable people to have rides in cars they have not been in before. Alan did a 
great job with all the barbecue cooking while Barbara had laid on a good 
selection of salads plus potatoes. Once the important business of eating was 
mainly over, the rides started. Wayne brought his Rover 100 and Richard came in 
his 4 1/2 litre Bentley which added to the variety. The age range as far as 
Jaguars was concerned spread from Doug&#8217;s XK120 to Steve Whitford&#8217;s brand new 
X-type diesel. The weather was ideal, so it was another enjoyable get together, 
(apart from the wasp).

Clock House Nursery had given us for our display at the Pageant.

If anybody finds this easier than writing out something and sending it to me, 
then please do so. I am just pleased to get copy for the Newsletter, however it 
gets there. <I></FONT></FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>(From our point

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We (Brian, Ron, Richard &amp; 
ourselves) arrived in convoy at 4pm precisely, having been given strict 
instructions not to get there any earlier as there would be no admittance. The 
first show area was already almost full, and we were lucky to get one of the 
last pitches. As always there was a terrific range of cars, including a number 
of magnificent Tatras. (I understand some 3,000 vehicles had pre-booked !) We 
were somewhat limited in the number of cars we saw as it was a bit of a social 
gathering for us; we had several visitors calling in to see us (people we once 
worked with!!).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Tradition has it that the 
evening ends for us with a quiet walk into Harpenden itself, to a wonderful fish 
n&#8217; chip shop (9/10 for brilliant crispy chips).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3><U>Croxley 
Green:</U></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Another hot evening &amp; we 
arranged to meet a friend who lived locally in the Church Langley Cricket Club, 
and then travel cross country to the Green. Unfortunately he had problems with 
his Jag. and phoned us to say he hoped to get along later, but never actually 
made it. We were surprised when we got there to see Ron and Brian had arrived 
before us, and luckily had saved us a nice space. Not such a good turn out as 
last year but still a nice assortment of cars including three Deal Bugattis and 
a lovely 1935 Alvis saloon. Richard arrived in his Bentley which attracted a lot 
of attention as usual, but Eric and his Team Escargot, with their stretched Limo 
(although not a classic) was a real crowd-puller! Chip van on site this year but 
only 6/10 as they were a bit soggy and not too hot. No loos at all !!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Two wonderful balmy summer 
Wednesday evenings.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Thank you for your 
congratulations message for Laura. She&#8217;s off to Cambridge in September for a 
year &#8211; so we&#8217;ve both got to keep working !

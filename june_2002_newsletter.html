<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The first item this month should 
give you all food for thought. After doing the job as Area Rep for eleven years, 
Alan Collins has decided that he will step down at the A.G.M. in March next year. He has 
made it known now, so that everyone has plenty of time to think whether it is 
something they feel they can take on. If there is someone that you feel would be 
good at the job, ask them if they would be prepared to stand . It is no use 
nominating someone at the A.G.M. if it is the first they have heard about it. As 
Area Rep it is essential to have an answerphone and mobile as well as ordinary 
phone, and the ability to deal with all manner of enquiries. 
Alan took over from Chris Engeham who was Area Rep for the first five years, so 
it is understandable that he feels it is now time for someone else to take over. 
Do give it serious thought and don&#8217;t just brush it aside till just before the 
A.G.M.

<P align=justify>ENFIELD PAGEANT - JUBILEE WEEKEND</B></U> </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Another successful and enjoyable 
Pageant again this year with twenty four cars on display on Sunday and twenty 
one on Monday. In addition, Phil and Heather Kendon&#8217;s Mk VII was in the Jubilee 
Marquee group, winning a specially commissioned boxed set of the State Landau 
and horses. In total we showed twenty nine different cars over the two days 
which shows just how many people were prepared to spend two days there with 
their cars. For the first time ever, we had an XK140 in our ranks, courtesy of 
David Ashton, who has now become a new member. On Monday we were joined by Will 
Plair from Essex with his Proteus C-type replica which generated a lot of 
interest. The Pageant weekend, more than any other time, is when we really do 
make a team effort for the Club, starting with Eric who organises all the passes 
with the Museum. As last year John W. cut the grass on our plot for us. I think 
Doug may have borne the brunt of car arranging but that and setting up the 
regalia is always a team effort. The Pageant would not be the same without the 
bacon rolls. Thanks to Barbara for all the shopping, and bacon frying, plus 
assistants, Heather, Eileen and myself. If there is anyone else who I should 
have given an individual mention to, forgive me, but as I say the whole weekend 
is a great team effort. I think putting on a good display is our main intention 
but the £50 runners up prize was also welcome.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Alan has passed on details of a show 
called Blasts From the Past Festival on 10th/11th August at Great Saling 
(between Great Dunmow and Braintree). It is a car show plus traditional funfair 
with strongest man contest, tug &#8216;o&#8217; war etc. Several people have got entry forms 
and&nbsp;entries do not have to be in until August 1st. We don&#8217;t seem to attend 
so many shows as a club as we used to; maybe this one might be worth a thought.

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">ENTENTE CORDIALE BURGUNDY TOUR 
2002 - report by Loraine &amp; John Clark</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">John and myself collected my Mum and 
Edwin and made our way through the rain and spray on the roads from London to 
Dover. On the approach to the Docks on first catching a glimpse of the sea I 
gasped &#8211; all the others asked what was wrong? I said &#8216;the sea is very rough&#8217; (I 
wanted to turn back home). We parked at the harbour side where there was already 
a display of lots of the Jaguars. As it was still raining we all met in the 
Churchill hotel where some Ententes had stayed the previous evening, this 
included Phil and Angie. Phil kindly pointed me in the right direction to 
collect the route book which has detailed road directions for each day&#8217;s tour. 
Considering the state of the sea the ferry crossing was pretty calm. No excuse 
to have a brandy or two &#8211; sorry John!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On arrival at Calais we headed for 
the motorway on which we covered some 128 kilometres (we are Europeans so no 
miles in this write up I&#8217;m afraid). After certain parts of the routes we had to 
zero the trip and I think John was doing this in his sleep. We then went through 
various towns and villages before arriving at Compiegne. We were then met at the 
Imperial Theatre by the Mayoress who gave a brief talk which unfortunately was 
difficult to hear. We enjoyed several glasses of decent champagne and snack 
biscuits. They had also made sandwiches from a loaf of bread which had been 
carefully placed back inside the crust of the bread &#8211; fascinating.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On arrival at our hotel on Friday 
evening we were informed by the receptionist that they had given our bedroom to 
a &#8216;Mrs Winter&#8217;. Well I&#8217;m not surprised she didn&#8217;t want the room as the bed was 
so hard &#8211; a great wooden board under the mattress, that we hardly slept all 
night. Thank you Mrs Winter, we&#8217;ll do the same for you some day. On Saturday we 
left Compiegne for our onward journey to Beaune in the Burgundy region. To help 
to make the journey fun there was a treasure hunt included in the route and I 
busily read out the clues which were set in rhyme &#8211; most were fairly clear but a 
few you had to think twice about. We stopped at Joigny, a garrison town, where 
they had a market where I bought a nice bag which I have been using ever since. 
We stopped for lunch just outside Joigny. Sainte Madeleine Sophie Barat was born 
in Joigny in 1779 and she was the founder of the Sacred Heart congregation 
dedicated to the education of girls. In the afternoon we arrived at Pascal 
Bouchard&#8217;s for Chablis wine tasting &#8211; I&#8217;m afraid it was not to our liking so we 
declined the buying. On arriving in Beaune we found our hotel, &#8216;The Panorama&#8217; 
and the view from our rooms was of vast vineyards. There was a swimming pool but 
it was outdoors so none of us braved it &#8211; although mainly warm and dry there was 
a strong wind.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Sunday was not a day of rest &#8211; no 
driving but lots to see and do in town by foot. Whilst the Ententes left their 
cars in a guarded car park so the French could enjoy looking at them we went 
into town where we visited the Hotel Dieu (Hospices de Beaune). This was a 
hospice used many years ago for people who were unwell and apparently, in times 
of epidemic, two had to share each bed. The outstanding feature of this building 
is it&#8217;s amazing multi-coloured and patterned roofs. We were then escorted around 
the centre of Beaune by a tour guide. After that we went to Patriarche winery 
where we were all given tastevins to which we attached our red, white and blue 
ribbons. Down in the cellars by candlelight we used our tastevins to sample both 
white and red wines. Only one or two were to our liking so we only bought a 
couple of bottles. Phil and Angie bought a bottle of blackcurrant 
cassis.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Monday was a visit to Autun but on 
the way we stopped at Château de Sully which is said to have the most beautiful 
courtyard of any Château in France. The Château was the birthplace of Field 
Marshal MacMahon, 1st Duke of Magenta, who was President of the French Republic 
in 1873.On arrival in Autun we all made our way to the Theatre where we were 
given a talk by the Deputy Mayor of Autun. The theatre was very ornate. Autun 
city was founded by Emperor Augustus as a prestige Roman town to honour the 
local Aedus tribe. The city&#8217;s position on the great commercial and military road 
between Lyon and Boulogne bought it great wealth and prosperity. There was a 
fantastic shop in town which sold a variety of hardware and where I could not 
resist buying a ceramic olive oil holder/bottle.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On the return trip to Beaune we 
stopped at a couple of monuments: Temple Janus &#8211; two walls of a square tower 
were probably the remains of the Sanctuary of the Temple; Portre St Andre &#8211; one 
of the survivors of 4 original gates in the Gallo-Roman fortifications and 
Pyramid Pierre Couhard which dates back to the 1st century AD and was either a 
funeral monument or a cenotaph come tomb. On arrival at the pyramid there were a 
couple of youths banging drums.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Tuesday was the Cote de Nuits tour. 
We drove to Château du Savigny les Beaune where the Jags parked all around the 
Château and in its grounds. The Château was built in the 14th century by 
Marechal de Bourgogne and was restored in the 17th century. The interior was 
restored more recently to accommodate receptions and Gala dinners.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Château houses four vehicle 
museums, namely The Arbath collection of 30 different models of endurance cars, 
the model aviation collection with over 650 small scale models, the motorcycle 
collection of 500 exhibits dating back to 1903 and a collection of 60 jet 
fighter planes &#8211; two of which were Jaguars and one of which had served in the 
Gulf war.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We carried on our journey for 32 
kilometres before reaching Nuits St George which is famous for its fine wine. 
After another 20 kilometres we stopped to visit Château Clos de Vougeot which 
was built in 1551 by Dom Loisier, the 48th abbot of the Cistercian community. We 
saw four huge wine presses built by the monks of Citeax; former wineries; a 
statue of the basket carrier sculpted by Henri Bouchard; a large storeroom; a 
28metre well dug into the rock near the former kitchens and a collection of old 
tasting cups. In 1944 the Château was bought by the Confriere de Chevalier Du 
Tastevin (Brotherhood of the Knights of the Tastevin) of which we watched a 
short video. Coaches picked up respective parties in the evening and took us to 
the Château du Savigny les Beaune for our Gala dinner. The rooms seated hundreds 
of us and although the service was good the same could not be said for the 
5-course meal and we may not bother booking up for it next year.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Wednesday was the start of our first 
leg home &#8211; Beaune to Compiegne. We arrived at our hotel to discover we had been 
allocated the same room as previously, remember the &#8216;hard bed&#8217; so I spoke to the 
lady in charge and she had no choice but to offer us another room &#8211; I can tell 
you the beds were soft and we had a good night&#8217;s sleep &#8211; I told you we would get 
our own back on Mrs Winter. At the recommendation of Bob and Jan who were also 
on the tour we booked to eat in the hotel restaurant that evening as John had 
already covered 393 kilometres during the day and not forgetting my navigating. 
The meal was the best all holiday &#8211; very enjoyable and tasty &#8211; with a variety 
between us of duck, chicken and salmon.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Thursday was the start of our last 
leg home to Calais and onwards. We went on back roads through Noyon and Villers 
Carbonnel where we had to constantly overtake big lorries, before reaching Arras 
where all the Jags parked in the Grande Place. There was a Porsche club already 
in the Place but their mere 19 exhibits were overshadowed by our 170 Jags. John 
briefly met John Maries of Jaguar Cars who was presenting the men with Jaguar 
tie pins. John M&#8217;s jag was a two-tone long wheel base Daimler Six &#8211; very 
impressive and roomy. You know what car we want next! We stopped for lunch at 
the same café as Phil, Angie and some of their friends. John being as helpful as 
ever assisted Angie by finishing off half a cow and chips. John had ordered a 
grand beer which was so large I could not even pick the glass up with one hand &#8211; 
he had to share it as he was driving &#8211; what a shame. I had a lovely avocado and 
crab salad and Mum and Edwin just had a drink. After lunch Mum and I bought some 
fresh bread to take home and then John chose some smelly cheeses as well in 
another shop. Back in the Daimler we headed for the motorway to take us the last 
stretch of the tour to Calais car ferry port. On arriving exactly on time at 4pm 
for the 5pm crossing we were told the ferry would be delayed by 20 minutes 
because it was windy.</FONT></P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P align=justify>Several of us got out of our cars and had a good gossip until 
it was time to load on to the ferry. The crossing wasn&#8217;t as good as on the way 
out &#8211; a lot of vibration and noise especially when we were held outside Dover 
for a while. We did a minimum of 1,900 kilometres over the holiday and 
thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and we are looking forward to next year.

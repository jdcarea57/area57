<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><STRONG>Well here we are again at the end of yet 
another year. A year that has seen 3 major hospital operations, 3 major 
birthdays, 3 breakfast runs, the list goes on and on.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><STRONG>Next year sees our 20th Anniversary as 
Area 57 and many ideas and suggestions have been made about the where’s and the 
when’s, so hopefully we will come up with something to suit all 
tastes.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><STRONG>The Christmas Dinner at Pearse House went 
off extremely well, with many good reports about the plentiful home-cooked food, 
and the lovely ambience about the place. The huge log fire in the entrance hall 
was very welcoming, and the team looked&nbsp;after us very 
well.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><STRONG>Once again we’ve achieved so much over the 
past year as a club and its success is down to the efforts of all of you. If we 
haven’t already had the Mince Pie night by the time you read this, which is on 
Monday 19th, I hope to see you all there or as many of you that can make it, as 
we always have a good turn out and normally far too much 
food.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><STRONG>For those of you unable to attend the 
Christmas Dinner your piece of Brian Kingsley’s birthday cake will be waiting 
for you there.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2><STRONG>I would just like to take this opportunity 
to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy &amp; Healthy New Year, and 
hope that 2006 is a good year for everyone. </STRONG></FONT></P>

<P align=justify></FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>One advantage of the 
Christmas Dinner being early in the month, is that I have a chance to write 
something about it, before mid-January, when it is fading into the 
past.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>This was our first visit to Pearse 
House at Bishops Stortford, and it seems to have been enjoyed by everybody. 
Suggestions that we return there next year have already been received. When Doug 
and I arrived, we were met by the young ladies offering orange juice or Buck’s 
Fizz, a lovely open fire, plus a fairy, a Christmas pudding, a sultan, and a 
jaguar (feline variety), coming down the grand staircase. Eileen and Dick were 
the fairy and the Christmas pud, and Margot, the cat. Eric was the sultan, or 
maybe one of the three wise men (or perhaps not!!) Keith O. and Heather also 
opted for fancy dress as a chef and a middle eastern lady.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>It had been decided that we would 
use this occasion to celebrate Brian Kingsley’s 60th birthday, even though mince 
pie night is nearer. Eileen had made a cake, complete with an E-type on the top. 
The saga of Alan’s white sports shirt continues, and it is now in Brian’s 
possession after we passed it on to him, wrapped and disguised in a 
box.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>As usual, the flying baloons were 
popular, and Margot provided our table with crackers containing numbered 
whistles. We just about managed a recognisable rendition of Happy 
Birthday.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>Thanks to Alan and Barbara for 
organising a very enjoyable evening.

<P align=justify>As usual, there are a couple of dates during the holiday period 
for anyone wishing to blow the cobwebs away. The EDVVS are having their regular 
run to The Sun at Nazeing on December 27th. The meeting for Bentleys and other 
interesting old cars on New Year’s Day has a change of venue. This time it will 
be at the Pre Hotel, Redbourn Road, St. Albans.

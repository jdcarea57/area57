<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I hope that everyone who 
intended to go to the BBQ at the M.G.Club managed to hear of the change of date 
from the 21st to the 14th August. It turned out to be a rather disappointing 
evening. We turned up in force with twelve cars and sixteen people. Although 
they put on a very good BBQ it was definitely a case of them and us, partly I 
think because not many of their members were there (despite the change of date 
being at their request). There really seemed to be three separate groups as we 
believe some of those present were from the Botany Bay Cricket Club. Although 
they have a lovely area, the car park is some way from the club house so there 
was no mingling to look at other people’s cars.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>This year was the first time 
that Doug and I have managed to get to the Harpenden Show and as other people 
have always said, it does attract about 2,000 cars of all shapes, sizes and 
ages, as well as motor bikes. A hot day finished with a thunderstorm and we left 
in heavy rain which had stopped by the time we had gone half a mile down the 
road.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had a very hot weekend at 
Peterborough and Stamford for XK weekend. A very pleasant eighty mile drive 
around the countryside was organised for Saturday; everyone agreed it was one of 
the best runs we have had. At the Saturday dinner, chairman Mick Duffy presented 
the various annual awards followed by a light hearted quiz. On Sunday morning we 
rejoined the A1 from the Peterborough Marriot, where we had been staying, for 
the journey to Stamford and XK Day at Burghley House. With perfect timing, Alan 
and Barbara came along at the same time, as they were joining us for the day, 
along with Tony and Lesley.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Ten of our cars were on 
display at the Show in aid of the Little Haven Hospice held at Althorne near 
Burnham on Crouch. It was a very pleasant relaxing day with plenty to look at; 
cars, tractors, stationary engines, owls, as well as craft stalls. The £40 
raised for selling the planted pots that Keith O’s son provided for the Pageant 
is given to this charity. The day finished with tea and cakes at Dick and 
Eileen’s caravan at Burnham.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Several of us are going to 
the Car Show at Croxley Green, near Rickmansworth on Sunday 17th September. I 
gather it attracts a large number of cars; spaces can’t be booked but we will 
try and keep an area when we get there at about 9.30 a.m. An added attraction is 
the Carter’s Steam Fair; going on previous experience, their dodgems are 
excellent. It is a long while since Area 57 have had a chance to enjoy some 
dodgems.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Barbara has booked the last 
Breakfast Run of the season and by general agreement, we are returning to the 
Woodman at Nuthampstead on October 8th. She has started collecting names for 
this and no doubt will be starting another list for the Christmas Dinner on 2nd 
December at Pearse House.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Finally, very belated 
congratulations to Ron and Pam Risk who tied the knot back in June. Very few 
people knew beforehand and I own up to forgetting to put it in last month’s 
newsletter.

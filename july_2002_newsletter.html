<P align=justify><FONT size=2>In the past few weeks various members have been 
out and about. Along with Dick and Eileen Rogers, Eric Tetsell and a friend, 
Doug and I&nbsp;went to XK weekend, which incorporated XK day at Ringwood Hall 
near Chesterfield, Derbyshire. The weather forecast for the entire weekend had 
been dubious to say the least, but all we had was a short shower just after 
arriving at the hotel, where afternoon tea was our immediate priority. The next 
morning we were given our routes for a tour around the Derbyshire Dales, which I 
gather was almost last September&#8217;s route in reverse. By the time we returned to 
the hotel, Chris and Mary Engeham had arrived. No particular tables were 
allocated for the evening&#8217;s dinner and it left the two of them at a table on 
their own, near ours. So after a quick word to the restaurant manager, a bit of 
furniture moving soon added their table to ours. They won two bottles of wine in 
the raffle and we won a bottle of champagne. Amongst the various trophies to be 
awarded was the Chairman&#8217;s Trophy and I think Doug was the most surprised person 
in the room when Brian Davis presented it to him. Surprise changed to 
embarrassment a few minutes later when it turned out that the hotel manageress 
had chosen our car as her favourite; so he had to collect another 
award.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2>When we first started going to XK days at Burleigh 
House in the late 80&#8217;s/early 90&#8217;s, there used to be rows of cars but those days 
have gone. However, the committee were quite pleased with the number of cars 
that did come. It is here that the XK is chosen to go forward to the Champion of 
Champions later in the year. A lot of very thorough polishing was going on all 
morning by the concours entrants, but we left before the winner was announced.

<P align=justify><FONT size=2>I understand that several people went to the 
Matching Green show. Apparently Richard Freestone thought he would pop in for a 
little while with his Bentley, but had to stay to the end as his car was chosen 
as Car of the Day.
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2>Despite some very heavy rain, the show at 
Harpenden attracted the usual hundreds of cars. Eric Tetsell met a couple who 
always come up from Somerset for a few days to include this gathering. For a 
virtually unadvertised show, this continues to attract more cars than any 
other&nbsp;you can think of.

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2>We had eleven cars on display in beautiful 
sunshine at Hoddesdon. As last year we were arranged around the War Memorial at 
the end of the High Street. There was a substantial number of cars on display of 
various ages and, as usual, it was a very relaxing day. Many thanks&nbsp;to 
Keith and Audrey Williams for their hospitality afterwards.

new Bentley Turbo R than the show.

<P align=justify><FONT size=2>We were very lucky with the weather, it was dry 
and warm, which allowed us to wander about at our own pace; there was a lot for 
us to see, this is a bonus.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2>We were given very good directions and we arrived 
on time, all exhibitors had to be parked up by 11.00 a.m as this was when the 
gates would be opened for the public. Once we were parked, first things first, 
we had a cup of tea. Then it was time to have a look around. The craft tents 
were packed with people tempting you with their goods, in fact you were spoilt 
for choice on where to spend your money. Then we strolled around the rest of the 
grounds. There were the general stalls that are at most car shows, but on top of 
this they had large areas set aside for talent shows. You could stop and watch 
for as long as you wanted! Mixed into all this was a fair ground. We went for 
just the one day, but if you had gone for both days you would still have found 
more than enough to have kept you fully entertained. A bonus as far as we were 
concerned, was the fact that the toilets were kept clean, they didn&#8217;t smell 
awful!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT size=2>I would say that the show was a great success and 
a big thank you to Vicki and Wayne Blackburn for the work that they put in to 
ensure a good time was had by all.</FONT></P><I>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Report by Eric

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Looking for an event that I 
had not been to before I decided, after scanning the skies for good weather, 
that I would support the Chiltern Vehicle Preservation Group at the 
11<SUP>th</SUP> Luton Festival of Transport. The Chiltern Vehicle Preservation 
Group is Luton&#8217;s answer to Enfield EDVVS. They advertised that a bus would be 
available to transport any interested party to Vauxhall Heritage Centre, but I 
didn&#8217;t see any buses. Anyway, the format for the show was along the lines of the 
Enfield Pageant, and why not as it certainly works.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Ecurie Ecosse car 
transporter was in attendance with 3 cars all in the Ecurie Ecosse livery, a C 
type, a XK120, and, if my memory serves me well, a Cooper. All of these cars are 
campaigned around the racing circuits of Europe and, as a special feature, they 
gave a demonstration on how it lifts the cars onto the deck. This is achieved by 
using a hydraulic winch and I must say it was very efficient. Originally a winch 
from a second world war bomber was used but as the ally casting had deteriorated 
so badly they decided to err on the side of caution and use a modern device. As 
I have an original corgi model of the transporter, and the vehicle&#8217;s Jaguar 
connection with Le Mans, it was rather special for me to see the transporter 
actually working as it was intended. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The show was well supported 
by auto jumble and auto memorabilia and as I was able to source very rare parts 
for the window winder of my XK I was a very happy bunny. Unfortunately the skies 
opened up and curtailed my participation in any other activities. To conclude, 
the show was well worth a visit and I would have no hesitation in attending next 
year.

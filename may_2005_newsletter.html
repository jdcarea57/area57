<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Just a brief reminder about 
the Pageant. As usual, please remember to be on site by 9 a.m and leave your 
keys with someone if you want to go walk about before all the cars are arranged. 
Bacon rolls, tea and coffee are all provided but please remember to bring a mug.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Breakfast Run on 24th 
April went well. Although it wasn’t BBQ weather it was a very pleasant sunny 
morning. For the first time breakfast was a help yourself buffet; the success or 
otherwise of this method depended on the time you joined the queue. As usual the 
morning finished with more tea and coffee at Alan and Barbara’s.

<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Unfortunately, 
Dick and Eileen couldn’t join us this year, so with just Eric and Margot we 
headed for Witney, Oxfordshire. As usual there were plenty of familiar cars and 
faces to meet up with. We were all together for a carvery dinner that evening. 
On Saturday morning, organiser Brian Davis welcomed everyone before we set off 
for our first venue; Didcot Railway Centre. Adjacent to the main line station 
there are plenty of engines and rolling stock to see, both restored and awaiting 
some TLC from the volunteers that all these railways depend on. En route from 
here to the next arranged visit we had a very heavy shower, but by the time we 
reached the Harcourt Arboretum the sun was shining again. This was a very 
pleasant area to wander around, with a bluebell wood being the highlight. Dinner 
was due for 8 p.m but the XK Committee had organised pre-dinner drinks without 
the knowledge of Brian and Mary who have been organising these weekends since 
about 1993. The new XK Chairman, Mick Duffy thanked them for all their hard work 
over the years especially as Mary’s health is poor. An engraved glass ornament 
was presented to them as well as a lovely bouquet for Mary. For once Brian was 
almost speechless.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On Sunday morning we drove a 
few miles to the Cotswold Wildlife Park, outside Burford. There are plenty of 
birds and animals to see, more than we really had time for, all in a lovely 
parkland setting. The highlight was probably a tiny three day old spider monkey 
with his or her mum. We had to be back for Sunday lunch at 1.30 p.m so we no 
doubt missed some things.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>After lunch most people were 
homeward bound although a few had booked an extra night. With the exception of 
the one shower and some overnight rain, the weather was very kind to us so once 
again it was an enjoyable weekend., with both cars running well.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As most of you will know, 
Dick Rogers has been storing and transporting the club tent, banner, and other 
regalia for the last few years, but he would now like to hand this 
responsibility over to someone else. The equipment will fit into almost any 
Jaguar, so if you feel you could take this on please let Alan know.

goes to charity. Please note that this event is open to pre-1976 vehicles only,

beforehand.

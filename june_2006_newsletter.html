<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As there was a good turnout 
at the first June meeting, we took the opportunity to sort out a date for a 
mid-season Breakfast Run. This will be on Sunday 16th July to the Woodman at 
Nuthampstead (off the A10, just south of Royston) where we had an excellent 
breakfast last year. The cost is expected to be £7 per head. As Alan and Barbara 
are on holiday at the moment, can anyone interested who hasn’t already put their 
name down, give me a ring.

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Just a reminder of a few of 
the up and coming dates in the next few weeks. Chilterns Day at the Buckingham 
Railway Centre which is off the A41 just past Waddesdon is on July 2nd as is the 
car show at Fanshawes. The Hoddesdon Show is on Saturday 8th July and as usual 
Keith and Audrey have invited us to their house for a cuppa afterwards. The 
following Monday evening, 10th July, is when Dick has arranged for us to go to 
the SS meeting at Potters Crouch. Apparently, sandwiches and wine are being 
provided. Hopefully the Harpenden Show on 26th July will have better weather 
than last year. Don’t forget this is for pre-booked entrants only. We will be in 
the Stamford/Peterborough area over the last weekend in July and hopefully some 
of you will join us for XK Day on 30th July at Burghley House. All Jaguars and 
other makes of classic cars will be parked together. If it rains, Burghley House 
is well worth a visit, and the Orangery has food ranging from snacks to a full 
roast.

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Brian K has given me the 
dates for this year’s shows at Croxley Green which I understand are like a mini 
Harpenden. The first is on Wednesday 2nd August (evening) and then on Sunday 
17th September when the Carters’ Steam Fair will be there. (Great dodgems!)

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>That is some of what is to 
come, but looking back it has been a pretty awful start to the season. The JDC 
50th at Eynsham Hall was held in constant pouring rain, with the grounds so bad 
in some places that the planned parking spaces for Areas such as ourselves 
couldn’t be used. It was a very disappointing day, with very little to see or do 
on such an awful day so most of us gave up by midday. At least we were able to 
do that but I felt sorry for people like Mick Duffy who were there to organise 
the event. There was a good turnout of cars despite the weather and I expect 
those who had come from various parts of the country and Europe for the ball on 
Saturday enjoyed the weekend. It has been several years since we have attended 
National Day as an Area and to be honest, unless there is more to do it is not 
likely to be a regular event for us.

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000000

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The following weekend was 
even more of a let down as, for only the second time in its history, the Enfield 
Pageant had to be cancelled due to the dreadful condition of the grounds. 
Despite bringing in eight lorry loads of bark, it was still too muddy and first 
thing Sunday morning it had to be cancelled. The Clock House Nursery (thanks to 
Keith O’s son) had again provided us with some decorative planted pots and these 
have now been bought by some of our members with the money to go to the Little 
Haven Hospice, whose show we will be attending on 20th August. The amount of 
work that goes into putting on a show the size of the Pageant is enormous so it 
must be both frustrating and disappointing for those who work so hard before, 
during and afterwards.

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the end of June, Phil 
and Heather Kendon will be moving to Somerset, so we wish them well in their new 
home. For several years, Phil has been Club Archivist and Heather has always 
been a willing member of the bacon roll team, so thanks to them both for their 
help and support to the Area.</FONT></DIV>

face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>I’ll start this month’s newsletter by thanking Alan 
and Barbara for organising our 20th Birthday celebrations last month. Nearly 
fifty of us were there, including some ex-members, some less familiar current 
members, and one couple joining us for the first time. Pearse House was the 
perfect venue for the evening as we were free to wander around between the 
dining room where an excellent buffet was laid out and the entrance hall where a 
T.V. was set up to show old videos of the club. All the club photo albums were 
also on display to look through at our leisure. It was a very enjoyable 
evening.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV>

<DIV align=justify><FONT size=2><FONT size=3><FONT size=3><FONT 
face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>I am sure we think to ourselves that the years have 
been kind to us but going back twenty years makes you very aware of the growing 
waist lines, receding hair, lines etc., Later on Doug and I got our own old club 
videos, mainly copies of the ones that John Ryan had provided for us. One thing 
that struck us about the early nineties was how busy car shows were then. A show 
at Essex, I think at Great Leighs, had our cars packed really closely together. 
Another example was Chigwell, where not only did we have about eighteen cars on 
display, there were so many more cars there than the show attracts today. We 
know from XK days that numbers have dwindled and reports of other Jaguar Shows 
in the Jaguar Driver give the same impression. It seems that in our Area’s early 
days we were lucky to be part of a very thriving classic car scene. Still after 
twenty years we are still going strong and we welcomed new members, Albert 
Scales and Malcolm and Francesca Bowdidge to our last meeting. We just met 
Albert and his wife Mary at our 20th birthday.

lower than usual due to people being away, nearly thirty of us enjoyed the first 
Breakfast Run of the season on 9th April. It was a crisp but bright morning so 
it was a good drive and as usual we finished up at Alan and Barbara’s afterwards 
where we enjoyed some more of the cake that Eileen had made for our party. 
Looking at the old Videos, I see that some of our regular breakfasters then are 
still members, so why not join us next 
time.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

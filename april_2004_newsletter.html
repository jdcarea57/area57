<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Although the May Newsletter 
will probably be with you before the Enfield Pageant over the Spring Bank 
Holiday weekend, I thought I would do the usual reminders now, just in case. 
First of all, if you are able to display your car on either the Sunday and/or 
Bank Holiday Monday and have not yet been in contact with Eric please give him a 
ring on&nbsp;as soon as possible. Please be on site BY NO LATER THAN 9 a.m. so 
that the display can be arranged with the least inconvenience. If you need to 
leave the stand before the cars are arranged, make sure you leave your keys with 
someone. Bacon rolls, tea and coffee will be provided by the club, but please 
remember to bring your own mugs. After all these years everyone should know what 
is needed on site. Tables are always useful, better to have more than we need 
rather than not enough.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>It may seem rather early in 
the year to talk about Club Subscriptions but from next year we will be making a 
slight change. Renewal forms are sent out with the December Newsletter, and 
anyone who doesn&#8217;t return this is then sent a final reminder with the January 
Newsletter. During February the new membership lists are compiled, so receiving 
renewals after this causes delay and additional work. In order to discourage 
late payment, it has therefore been decided that renewals received after the end 
of February will incur an additional £5.00 rejoining fee.

WITH EDVVS - (Friday 16th-Sunday 18th April)</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>

Keith Williams</FONT></P></B></I><B><U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Friday</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>A beautiful sunny morning &#8211; 
HOOD DOWN &#8211; ready for a leisurely drive through the Cotswolds. We had carefully 
planned our route with the aid of &#8216;The Good Pub Guide 2004&#8217;, and had selected a 
National Trust hostelry, &#8216;The Fleece&#8217; , at Bretforton, near Evesham for lunch. 
When we arrived shock, horror ! the place was closed for renovation !!. Luckily 
we found a pub in the next village which served the purpose.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We met up with the rest of 
the party from Whitewebbs for dinner at the Abbey Hotel (Best Western). 
Afterwards we really had to concentrate, as the now famous compulsory quiz was 
distributed. This time the theme was based on Cinema films, the cryptic clues 
for which were somewhat challenging to say the least ! We&#8217;ll use some of the 
easier questions for our Club trip in September !!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" 
size=3>Saturday</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Another sunny morning &#8211; HOOD 
DOWN again- to join the convoy of 45 different vehicles (ours being surprisingly 
the only E-type &#8211; makes a change!) to the Black Country Open Air Museum ,near 
Dudley. Although we had visited it before, there was still plenty to see and do. 
Our favourites were the trip down the coal mine and the ride on the canal narrow 
boat underground where they used to transport the coal &amp; limestone . All the 
trips incidentally being included in the price of the weekend &#8211; brilliant 
value.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Saturday night was &#8216;The Mad 
Hatters Party&#8217;. We cheated and wore two &#8216;Castaway&#8217; Straw Hats out of Laura&#8217;s old 
fancy-dress collection &#8211; but some people had gone to a lot of trouble making 
their own creations. There was a forfeit to be paid for anyone not wearing a hat 
to dinner !</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" 
size=3>Sunday</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>A wet , windy morning &#8211; HOOD 
definitely up! &#8211; to join the rally to Cadbury&#8217;s World at Bournville only some 
8-10 miles away. Again we had visited it before some 12 years ago so were not 
particularly enthusiastic. Unfortunately, they have made many changes and it is 
now a sort of childrens Theme Park with rides, clowns, videos and amusement 
arcades. Not much of the old factory or the chocolate-making process to be seen. 
Still. Laura enjoyed all the free samples we had collected on the way round 
!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We returned to the hotel for 
Sunday lunch and presentations. Sadly, Stan Chamberlaine was awarded the 
Breakdown Trophy ( Piston Broke) as his S-type Jag had to be trailered home to 
Radlett from the Black Country Museum, as his power-steering unit had completely 
packed up.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We left Redditch at just 
before 4pm in torrential run and apart from getting wet knees from the 
inevitable leaks from the hood we arrived home safely just after 6pm, after 
another very enjoyable weekend, with very friendly people. Several members from 
the EDVVS again told us they would welcome more Jag Club people to come 
along.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Once again we pass on the 
open invitation to a further weekend in October?

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>JAGUAR XJ - First 
Impressions of the seventh generation of Jaguar&#8217;s big 
saloon</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>From Motoring &amp; Leisure 
(by Peter Cracknell)</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We don't see bad new cars any 
more, just varying shades of good ones, and every once in a while one that is 
exceptional, like the new Jaguar XJ - seventh in a long line of big saloons that 
started life in 1968 with the code name experimental Jaguar.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>To maximise the appeal of the 
new model, Jaguar apparently focused on style and driving dynamics. If part of 
style is the impression the car gives you on first seeing it, then improvements 
here seem to have been less than revolutionary. However, Jaguar were mindful of 
the fact that focus groups of existing customers had praised the design as it 
was - they didn't see the need for change - so substantial revisions to the 
outline were a no-no. But under the skin there are changes aplenty: for a start, 
that skin is now made of aluminium. Obvious advantages of this 200kg weight 
saving are improved performance and economy, but for the keen driver there's the 
added bonus of a more nimble car, one that feels smaller than it actually is. 
Ally this to new air suspension, and the big family saloon could, with the right 
engines, become a driver's delight.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Any of the four engines on 
offer - a 3.0-litre V6, plus V8s of 3.5, 4.2 and 4.2 supercharged - ensures that 
it does. The inclusion of a V6 enables a lead-in price not too far removed from 
the base of the old range. It's a very smooth performer with ample performance 
to enable one to enjoy the car's amazing ride and handling. The suspension 
system of all models uses Jaguar's Computer Active Technology Suspension which 
adapts ride firmness and height to match the manner in which the car is being 
driven. SE and Sport variants do have slightly different initial settings, but 
none is harsh, and the changes that CATS makes as one takes tight bends or 
drives gently in a straight line are imperceptible; just like the gear changes. 
Six-speed auto transmission is standard, and the only way you can tell that the 
system has changed gear is to look at the rev counter; you can't normally hear 
the engine, and you can't feel the change.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>The V8 engines are naturally 
even smoother than the V6, and culminate in the supercharged 4.2 which we first 
reported on when it appeared in the S-type R last year. Despite being a larger 
car than the S-type, the aluminium XJ drives, handles and performs like a true 
sports car, yet the ride is totally comfortable. It is, I assure you, a 
memorable experience, but you'll tell me that with prices running from 39 to 
over 68 thousand pounds, it should be!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>With a length of over five 
metres it's no surprise that legroom is generous all round. Boot space is 
improved over the old model, and now measures 470 litres (16.6 cubic feet), 
though it's still a fairly shallow compartment. All models feature front, side 
and curtain airbags, ABS, emergency brake assist, plus automatic handbrake, 
headlights and wipers, and electric operation of almost everything.

CLASSIC</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Daily Express - Saturday 10th 
April</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Is the Jaguar E-Type the most 
beutiful car of all time? Elegant, glamorous, and surprisingly good value for 
money, there&#8217;s a lot to be said for the car that was unveiled to an astounded 
public at the 1961 Geneva Motor Show.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>The good news is that you&#8217;ll 
be able to take a step back in time if you take a trip to London this summer. 
From August 1st an exhibition, The E-Type - Story Of A British Sports Car, which 
celebrates the Coventry firm&#8217;s favourite coupe and one of the main cultural 
icons of the Sixties, will be on show at the Design Museum. Featuring 
memorabilia and rare cars from the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust, the exhibition 
will trace the evolution of the E-Type from Jaguar&#8217;s XK120, C-Type and D-Types, 
which won the 24-hour races at Le Mans five times in the Fifties, as well as 
details of the early development of the 150mph E-Type under the supervision of 
the marque&#8217;s founder, William Lyons.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P>What is often forgotten about the E-Type is just what good value it was. At 
just £2,097 for its roadster model, it was half the price of a Ferrari or an 
Aston Martin that had similar performance. The museum, in Shad Thames near Tower 
Bridge, will be running the E-Type exhibition until November 28th, with adult 
tickets costing £6. Further details are available by phone on 0870-833 9955 or 
on website <A href="http://www.designmuseum.org/">www.designmuseum.org</A>

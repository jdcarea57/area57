<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"><B><U>MORE NUMBERPLATE 
PROBLEMS?</B></U> - <B></FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Owners of certain 
classic cars could face more uncertainty about numberplates if DVLA proposals to 
introduce electronic plates are made law.</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">From Classic Car 
Weekly</FONT></I></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Another threat to 
classic number plates may be on the way in 2004, with a proposal to introduce 
electronic numberplates which can be recognised by beacons and cameras by the 
roadside, and by 2007, if the plans come to fruition, every vehicle in Britain 
will have to have them.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The DVLA is exploring ways that 
security can be improved on numberplates, and one option is that plates will 
have a microchip containing vehicle details such as make, colour, engine, 
registered keeper, MoT status and insurance. If introduced, new plates will have 
to be fitted to over 29-million vehicles, including many classics. The fear 
among classic owners is that old style plates with white/silver lettering on a 
black metal background won't be manufactured with electronic tags on them, and 
all cars will have to sport modern plates.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">"My concern is that the DVLA will, I 
am sure, insist on these plates being the yellow/white with black lettering 
type, as used by modern cars, with, no doubt, the additional indignity for 
classic cars of the blue EU flag," said <I>Classic Car Weekly </I>reader Hugh 
Taberner.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A question mark also hangs over how 
the system would be implemented on classics with stick-on numberplates, like the 
Jaguar E-type. However, the DVLA is remaining traditionally tight-lipped about 
the plans. A spokesman told CCW, "The DVLA is currently exploring a number of 
options for making number plates more secure - electronic tagging is merely one 
of those options. Recent articles in the media are a gross exaggeration of the 
current position. A consultation exercise would be undertaken prior to the 
introduction of any changes."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The possible move would be the 
latest 'Big Brother' measure aimed at motorists, although the electronic plates 
could dramatically cut down on the number of vehicle thefts. Police cars are 
also likely to have the numberplate readers, and any false plate spotted will 
alert the police national computer and the DVLA. The beacons and cameras will 
also be able to search for vehicles reported stolen.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">This latest news marks the end of a 
bad year for classic number plate manufacturers. Earlier in 2002, <I>CCW</I> 
revealed the news that from January 1, 2003, plate manufacturers will have to be 
registered and record identity details of both vehicle and purchaser of any 
replacement plates. As those making plates will have to have sight of original 
documents, this is likely to create serious problems for those manufacturing 
pre-1973-style plates, with the majority of their sales coming via mail 
order.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Only last week, the hazards of 
letting important personal documents out of owners' hands was highlighted by the 
BBC when a reporter managed to obtain a provisional driving licence in the name 
of home secretary David Blunkett by using a copy of his birth certificate. The 
hijacking of people's details by criminals has tripled in the past two years, 
with fake identities being used to commit fraud and aid illegal immigrants to 
enter and stay in Britain.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">There is a shred of good news for beleagured mail 
order numberplate manufacturers though. Although the requirement for companies 
to register with the DVLA came in as planned at the beginning of January, 
prosecutions for those who don't will not be introduced for three 
months.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">

December</FONT></P>

is the sort of building usually found on Christmas cards, surrounded by snow and 
with a coach and horses outside. Inside everything looked very welcoming and 
Christmassy. Our tables were upstairs in the gallery area and the service was 
all pretty efficient. I can only speak for those on our table but the opinions 
of the food and general ambience was favourable.</FONT>

the cobwebs during the holiday period; the EDVVS run to the Sun at Nazing on 
27th December and the gathering at the White Horse, Shenley on New Year&#8217;s 
Day.&nbsp; The New Year&#8217;s Day meeting always attracts a large number of Bentleys 
and other very elderly cars that make ours look like mere youngsters.

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#000000><EM>I thought I might contact you with 
details of our company and how we could possibly be of service to your members. 
</EM></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#000000><EM>We are a company based in 
Barton-le-Clay Bedfordshire and are stockists of leather for car interiors. 
Approximately 12 months ago we began offering a bespoke service to the niche 
market where we began producing bespoke autohide offering a colour matching 
service . This has proved quite successful especially for car enthusiasts who 
are wanting to have their car interiors refurbished to it's original (leather 
colour) specification. We are producing bespoke leather for Jaguar customers 
both in the u.k and Europe and feel that we offer a unique service. With the 
demise of the Connolly Brothers we have found that it has become quite difficult 
to obtain the Connolly colour range and we recently began stocking a number of 
ex -Connolly colours of which we have produced a colour chart. The leather has a 
natural haircell grain and is a grade A European hide. I thought this may be of 
interest to you and your members our doors are always open and our leather is 
available and stocked at our workshops.</EM></FONT></P>

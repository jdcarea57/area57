<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">By now, I expect that the majority 
of you will be aware that we had another successful Enfield Pageant. We were 
awarded first prize in the competition for Best Club Stand, which puts £250 in 
our kitty. Although Doug and I were not able to be there on the Sunday, I gather 
that the display got a lot of attention.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks go to Brian Stevens for 
bringing along his XJ220 and Lister XJS and Steve Whitford who brought along a 
brand new S-type diesel complete with TV in the back. Everyone who brings their 
cars on either or both days helps to create the excellent display that we put on 
every year.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">As usual Eric organised everything 
for us as far as passes and booking is concerned. Don&#8217;t forget he will be 
needing names for the Town &amp; Country Show at Trent Park on August Bank 
Holiday Monday.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A big thank you also goes to the 
Clockhouse Nursery, Forty Hill for once again supplying us with planters for our 
stand, and to Keith Oswick for arranging this. These were sold at the end of the 
event to raise funds for Martin Rogers&#8217; Day Centre.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Since the Club started displaying on 
two days, this was the first time that we had not been there for both. Why do I 
get the impression that my cakes were what was missed most on the Sunday!!

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">At a recent Club meeting, we were 
chatting about why we don&#8217;t seem to do so much together as a club as we did in 
earlier years. I think a lot of the reason is that many events are repetitious, 
so to use the well know phrase, "we&#8217;ve been there, done that, and got the 
T-shirt". As a result we have tried to sort out a few new places and organise a 
couple of social occasions.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Report by Dick 
Rogers</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The trip to the Show turned out to 
be a test of endurance. Six cars were booked, our Mk2, Alan and Barbara&#8217;s 
E-type, Phil and Heather&#8217;s M7 made it; three out of six. Bill Starling&#8217;s E-type 
had a petrol problem, Eric suffered a broken oil pipe on the M25 and had to be 
towed home. Keith and Audrey&#8217;s car was okay but Keith&#8217;s knee wasn&#8217;t! (hope it 
gets better soon). Brian Kingsley was bullied into going by Ron Risk as his car 
needed a run, so he turned up. A good day was had by all with plenty of Eileen&#8217;s 
food. The museum is like a larger version of Whitewebbs with seven acres of 
grounds. It was nice to see Club members prepared to travel further over to Phil 
and Heather&#8217;s and Alan and Barbara&#8217;s way for a change.</FONT></P><FONT

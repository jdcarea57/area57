2003</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Although some of our regulars 
weren&#8217;t able to make the the first Breakfast Run of the year, we still finished 
up with nearly forty people. The weather was chilly but dry; certainly not like 
last year when several peopled stayed on at Alan and Barbara Collins' place for 
an impromptu BBQ.

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">HARTHAM COMMON CENTENARY SHOW 
- 4th May 2003</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">This was an extremely successful 
show, which was marking the centenary of the then Mayor of Hertford&#8217;s invitation 
to members of the Automobile Club to drive their vehicles to Hertford in order 
to show the public the latest mode of transport. Almost two dozen pre First 
World War vehicles made an excellent display and were put through their paces 
around the arena during the afternoon. Eight of our cars had a perfect 
river-side position, where we were joined by several other Jaguars, a Swallow, 
and the Jaguar powered Allard Palm Beach which many of you have seen at various 
shows. A selection of our cars were asked to go around the arena before lining 
up for a chat with the commentator. Alan said a few words about our cars as they 
came in and, as a result, has asked all of us who take our cars to shows if they 
could let him have a brief account of their vehicles so that he can refer to 
them if the occasion arises. Dick Rogers took his Mk V, and as well as being 
part of our parade was also asked to show his car in the arena to represent the 
Fifties in a display by decade. There was a slight hiccup when a fuse blew, but 
everything was sorted out for his second appearance. There was a wide variety of 
cars, plus charity stalls and several new dealerships. The event was being run 
by five local Rotary Clubs and their marshalling and organisation was excellent. 
The glorious weather made this a very pleasant day out, which hopefully will 
have raised plenty of money for local charities as well.

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">XK WHITE ROSE WEEKEND 9-11th 
May 2003</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We set off for this Yorkshire 
weekend with me nursing a rhododendron on my lap (Eileen Rogers' birthday 
present) and hoping that it wouldn&#8217;t lose too many petals before we gave it to 
her. The four of us set off in bright sunny weather, and all was well till just 
before Peterborough when Doug spotted Dick Rogers coasting to a halt on the hard 
shoulder. The problem turned out to be something not tightened enough on the 
distributor after a service a few days previously. Soon after that we 
replenished petrol tanks and stomachs and continued on our way. We arrived 
safely at our hotel looking out to sea between Scarborough and Whitby, after 
taking a few detours along some twisty hilly roads that we used to travel on 
when having several holidays in this area back in the seventies.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">As usual on these weekends, the 
majority of people there were familiar faces. Saturday morning saw organizer 
Brian Davis give his usual welcome chat and point out a few things about the 
places we were to visit. The first stop was Eden Camp, originally built as a 
P.O.W. camp in 1942, it is now an excellent museum of civilian life during World 
War II, with each hut representing a particular theme. There is far too much to 
mention here as to do it justice takes several hours. One thing caused general 
amusement; an outside "lavvy" which on pushing the door regales you with "Hang 
on a minute!". The museum has won several well deserved Tourist 
Awards.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A totally different era for our next 
visit; Castle Howard which is where Brideshead Revisited was filmed. After a few 
problems, Brian eventually got agreement for us all to park on the grass in 
front to of the main facade of the house. It was a lovely setting with a large 
lake behind us. We made our own way around with guides in each room to answer 
questions. The grounds, needless to say were far too extensive to explore 
thoroughly. On returning to our cars, an American man was looking at our car and 
he called his elderly mother over saying that it was like the one she had bought 
for her husband years ago. He remembered crying when his father sold it and 
bought a Porsche. It must have been a DHC as he remembered being stuffed behind 
the seats.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The next morning we drove a few 
miles along the coast to the ruins of Whitby Abbey and its new visitor centre. 
Some people tackled the 199 steps down to Whitby town and back, which included 
resting places for coffins!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Back to the hotel for lunch and 
good-byes to those of the group who were heading for home. Like quite a few 
others, we had booked for an extra night and decided to drive back down to 
Whitby to see the town. It was here that the weather changed and it poured. Lots 
of surface water was on the road as we drove back to the hotel and an oncoming 
car drove through a puddle, most of which went over our windscreen and into our 
laps!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Luckily the weather was better the 
next morning and we only had a few showers on our way home. As usual Brian and 
Mary had organised a very enjoyable weekend and he is already planning next 
years, probably the South of England so we won&#8217;t have such a long journey as 
Plymouth last year and Yorkshire this time. We put nearly 650 miles on the 
clock.

<P align=justify><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"><U>A SOMERSET SOIREE - <I>Friday 
May 2nd - Whitewebbs Museum weekend in Wells</B></I></U> </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Report by Audrey 
Williams</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Murky, misty, wet &amp; miserable 
-M25 Motorway madness.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A five hour journey in the E-type on 
a Friday afternoon was not the best start to the weekend! The Swan Hotel was a 
lovely and welcome surprise - an old 15th Century oak-beamed coaching inn, with 
views over the impressive cathedral. Beautiful surroundings and excellent food - 
plenty of roast potatoes! Parking, however at the back of the hotel for the 50 
odd cars was a slight problem.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Saturday was mainly dry but cold. We 
drove in convoy to Wookey Hole for a guided tour of the caves &amp; adjoining 
working paper mill. We both enjoyed a cream tea for our lunch (unusual) and 
Keith had a glass of the local scrumpy with his (even more unusual !)</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The convoy moved on to Cheddar Gorge 
where an open-topped double-decker bus had been arranged to take us down into 
the village. We shivered on the top deck. In the evening, after another lovely 
meal, there was one of Whitewebbs&#8217; now infamous raffles and a motor quiz which 
we may re-cycle at a later date. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The highlight of the weekend was a 
visit to the Haynes Motor Museum on Sunday morning. Amazing cars- but no photos 
of Wayne's wedding anywhere!! This was followed by lunch at a local inn and the 
presentation of the "piston broke" trophy and a "grope" photograph. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P align=justify>A great weekend and fantastic value - some friendly people (77 
in all) and an open invitation for all members of the EDVVS in our club to join 
them on their next soiree in 
2004.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

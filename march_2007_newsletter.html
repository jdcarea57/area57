<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Monday 19th March - Minutes of the 21st 
A.G.M.</FONT></P>
<P></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Twenty people were at the A.G.M. 
this year, five more than last year. Alan thanked everyone for coming and it was 
agreed by everyone present that the minutes of last year's meeting should be 
taken as read.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Area Rep's Report</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Alan went through the various events and 
places visited over the past year. The highlight was our party at Pearce House 
to celebrate the Area's 20th birthday, when it was good to see not only some of 
our less regular members but some ex-members as well. It was a very enjoyable 
evening with videos and photo albums of the Club over those twenty years. We had 
three Breakfast Runs throughout the year; the first in April to the Cricketer's 
at Rickling Green, then both the mid season and end of the season runs were to 
The Woodman at Nuthampstead which has proved to be a very popular venue. What 
should have been the two biggest events of the year were both washouts 
unfortunately. The Enfield Pageant had to be cancelled for only the second time 
in its history because the ground was almost unusable due to the heavy rain in 
the days leading up to the weekend. The same fate befell the J.D.C. 50th 
celebrations which went ahead in appalling conditions. As usual we went to two 
town centre shows; Hoddesdon and Buntingford with Keith and Audrey providing tea 
and cakes in their garden after the first of these. Harpenden was the usual 
success with hundreds of cars of all ages shapes and sizes. Another show rather 
like a small Harpenden was the one at Croxley Green; again there was a good 
range of vehicles plus the added attraction of Carter's Steam Fair with their 
excellent dodgems. The show near Burnham on Crouch in aid of the Little Haven 
children’s’ hospice was an enjoyable event with plenty to see as well as cars. 
Dick and Eileen invited us back to their nearby caravan for tea and cakes 
afterwards. The event raised about £7,000. The Trent Park Show fared better than 
the Pageant although there were some heavy showers and it was notable as the 
last occasion that we enjoyed Dave Norton's commentary before he and Penny 
emigrated to Australia. There are usually some weekends away throughout the year 
and although we had to miss the XK weekend in North Wales, the one incorporating 
XK Day at Stamford was enjoyable. The EDVVS was in the Bridgenorth area but I 
gather that the hotel left quite a bit to be desired. For our own Area weekend 
in Norfolk we were lucky, with very good weather and a comfortable hotel. 
Throughout the year Dick has been a regular visitor to the Ace Cafe. IT was back 
to Pearce House again for our Christmas dinner. There are probably several other 
events that I have not mentioned but Alan's run through gave us a reminder of 
2006 which for him had been rather an eventful one as far as health is 
concerned.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Treasurer's Report</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A very healthy Statement of Accounts was 
presented by Barbara Collins, with the majority of our expenses being fairly 
consistent from year to year.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Secretary/NewsletterEditor's 
Report</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Wendy Shipman thanked Roy and Kim Fludgate 
for their work in producing and distributing the Newsletter every month in what 
has been written in my not very good handwriting until the last few months. We 
have just about reached the 21st century now and by E-mailing the Newsletter to 
them they now get it two days earlier. My usual thanks to those who have written 
anything for me and a request for more write-up's of events that people go 
to.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Membership Secretary's 
Report</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Roy Fludgate reported that there were seven 
lapsed memberships this year, mainly people who have moved away or do not have 
their car any longer. We have a new member, France Aliphon who owns an XJS that 
used to be his father's. Unfortunately he has a difficult journey to get to 
meetings. It is not easy to get young people into the Club as these days the 
prohibitive cost of insurance makes it difficult. We have 37 memberships 
representing 57 people and 61 cars. There has been regular contact with JDC 
Editor Steve Fermor as a result of the web site, which still gets plenty of 
hits.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Election of Officers</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It was unanimously agreed that Barbara 
Collins, Wendy Shipman and Roy Fludgate would carry on as before with Brian 
Kingsley continuing to act as Club Archivist. For several years Alan has 
expressed a wish to stand down as Area Rep; understandable after fifteen years 
service. Doug Shipman has agreed to take over on the firm understanding that it 
would be for a maximum term of three years, and this is a policy that was agreed 
for the future. Alan has given a lot of commitment to the Area over the years, 
which I'm sure is appreciated by us all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There was nothing raised for discussion 
under Any Other Business so Alan closed the meeting. </FONT></P><B>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Presentation of the John Dyall 
Trophy</FONT></P>
<P></B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Valerie Dyall was with us to present 
the Trophy, which this year went to Tom Jones; a very popular choice.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>With the AGM concluded we then began the 
usual meeting. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There is probably still time to contact 
Barbara to book for the Breakfast Run on April 15th to the Woodman at 
Nuthampstead near Royston. If anyone is interested in U.S aircraft from the 
second World War there is a lot of memorabilia there as well as a good breakfast 
after a nice early drive. Meeting places are the usual ones at Royal Forest 
Hotel and opposite MacDonalds in Bullsmoor Lane. Lately not so many people have 
been meeting at the Royal Forest so if you do intend to go there please let John 
&amp; Loraine know.

<P></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Dick has been given information by Nik 
Drukker about a charity flying day at RAF Halton near Wendover (not far from 
Tring) on June 24th. Tiger Moths &amp; early DeHaviland planes will be flying 
with trips in them available. I believe the cost is £60. Classic cars would have 
prime parking and could possibly give rides along the runway to people, 
presumably to also raise money for the children's charity that is being 
supported. Although this is not until June 24th Dick needs to give some numbers 
to Nik as soon as possible.

<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Greenwood Exhibitions are holding shows at 
Shuttleworth College on May 6th &amp; 7th, Barleylands Showground, Billericay on 
14th &amp; 15th July and Knebworth on 26th &amp; 27th August. Dick has given me 
an entry form for these shows but it does mention that pre booking has to be 
done 28 days before the event.

<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I understand that the great potato 
challenge is on again this year ; if you are a budding spud grower Dick can tell 
you more.

<P></P>
<P><I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Thanks to Dick for the following two 
articles; what a lot of typing practice I'm getting!

<P><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A Day at Pinewood Studios - March 
1st</FONT></U></B></P>
<P><B><U></B></U><B><I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>By Dick Rogers (Film 
Star)</FONT></I></B></P>
<P><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At about 6.30 a.m, John 
Wilkinson in his Mk2 and I went round the M25 to the M40 to go to the studios. I 
was in my well travelled XK150 but John's car had never been so far from home 
before. When we arrived we were sent to wardrobe and makeup. I had a suit and 
tie while John was in casual clothes from the late 60's. We had breakfast and 
then we were sent to the set, which was a mock up of Baker Street in London in 
1971, where a robbery had taken place. There were at least twenty Classics there 
ranging from vans to an Austin Healey. We were sent up and down a one way three 
lane road with directions from a young lady. On one run, John's boot lid came 
undone and was going up and down. By about midday his battery was flat and he 
went home. I don't know who had been more frightened at being 33 miles from 
home, John or his car!! I stayed till about 8.30 and had a good run back along 
the M25. It was a good day, meeting the other owners and getting paid for it. 
Film work is not to be recommended if you don't like doing a lot of driving. The 
main actor in the film was David Suchet.

Rogers</FONT></I></B></P>
<P><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Five members enjoyed doing 
what we used to do a lot more of; driving our cars, when we took a run up to the 
Silver Ball cafe near Royston on a sunny Sunday morning. We met at Eric's; Doug 
in his 120, Ron in his E-type. Unfortunately Keith Oswick's Mk2 had run out of 
MOT so he travelled down in Ron's car and back in mine. With Eric's 150 
completing the group we took it in turns to lead so we could all enjoy the 
different exhaust sounds. A good time was had by all.

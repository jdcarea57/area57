<DIV align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I don&#8217;t know 
whether many of you remember The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin on TV, in 
which Geoffrey Palmer regularly had a "bit of a cock up on the catering front". 
That is how our Christmas Dinner plans can be described. Despite booking at the 
George IV, (where the event has been held for the past two years), back in June, 
Barbara was recently informed that they had mistakenly booked us in for lunch 
not dinner on 8th December. After several phone calls, however, we have found an 
alternative; the Plough in Cattlegate Road, Enfield. The date remains the same, 
and we will have their conservatory restaurant to ourselves.</FONT><FONT

at Amwell, and this will be the first time that we have held the Area Christmas 
Dinner in Enfield.</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>

<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the end of September, 
the Cancer Research Show was held at a new venue; The Royal Oak in Stapleford 
Abbots. Despite a very wet day, I understand quite a few of our cars braved the 
elements and Len and Sally Smerald's E-type was chosen by one of the "London&#8217;s 
Burning" cast as his favourite car. Gwynith has told me they raised about £700 
and&nbsp;her letter of thanks follows.

HAVILLAND AIRCRAFT HERITAGE CENTRE - Sunday 14th October 
2001</U></STRONG></FONT></FONT></FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" 
size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>About two 
dozen of us visited the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre at London Colney, 
where we were allocated our own parking area outside the main hangar. We were 
made very welcome by Reg Davey who had been an observer on various types of 
aircraft during the war. He gave us a history of the development of the wood 
construction high speed unarmed bomber which became known as the Mosquito. 
Although I can tell the difference between a Tiger Moth and a Spitfire and a 
Jumbo Jet from Concord, my aviation knowledge is extremely limited, to say the 
least, so I can&#8217;t tell you much about the various de Havilland planes and 
memorabilia on display. Several of the "boys" took the opportunity to scramble 
up into a Mosquito and found the thought of spending up to eight hours in such 
cramped conditions with the noise and vibration of the engines, pretty awful. 
The Museum is staffed entirely by volunteers who give up their spare time to 
help renovate aircraft, engines etc. as well as showing people round. They hope 
to develop an education centre and eventually apply for lottery 
funding.</FONT></DIV>

<DIV align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>After a 
couple of hours, most people came back to our house for tea and cakes. It was a 
bit of a squash, but we just about managed to fit everyone in!

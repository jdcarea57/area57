<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had our third Breakfast 
Run of the season on 8th October. It was also the third time that we had been to 
the Woodman at Nuthampstead, having held our last two summer runs there. It was 
a beautiful sunny morning so an early drive on quiet roads was a pleasure. Our 
nephew Graham lives in Reed, the next village, so we arranged for him and his 
friend Helen to join us. While getting ready to bring his 1930’s Triumph Gloria, 
he was surprised to see Alan and Barbara followed by Graham and Karen. He did 
wonder whether we were all having a scenic ride but the reason was the wrong 
turning taken by Alan and Barbara. I am assured that it was driver error, not 
the navigating. We all enjoyed a very good breakfast although our numbers were 
down a bit. As I said last month, it would be a great pity to stop this 
traditional start and end to the season.

names to Barbara for the Christmas Dinner on 2nd December at Pearse House, the 
same venue as last year. She will require a deposit of £5 per head.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Keith W. passed me an article 
recently in which The Times motoring correspondent had been given the rare 
chance to drive the only Jaguar XJ13 since the JDHT had completely restored it 
in the summer. It had been designed to compete at Le Mans in the mid sixties. 
The 502 bhp, 5 litre V12 engine was ready in 1964 but by the time the car was 
ready two years later it had already been outpaced by the 7 litre Ford GT40 and 
the XJ13 was never entered. Nobody really knows the value of this one off car, 
but ten years ago the JDHT turned down an offer of £7 million. The beautiful car 
was the work of Malcolm Sayer, the man behind the C, D, and E-types. Norman 
Dewis, the former chief test driver for Jaguar had a near fatal accident with 
the car in 1971 while filming a promotional video, when a wheel collapsed at 145 
mph. It flipped , somersaulted and barrel-rolled into a field, but Dewis, a 
small man, was able to retreat under the dashboard and wasn’t hurt.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Andrew Frankel writes that 
although the experience of driving such a rarity at Gaydon track was 
nerve-racking, it was not a difficult car to drive as Jaguar had been well aware 
that winning a race like Le Mans didn’t depend just on the car, but not tiring 
the drivers. The full syncromesh gearbox will not allow you to miss out gears, 
the clutch is as gentle as a road car and the engine for all it’s ferocity idles 
cleanly and pulls away smoothly. The acceleration is savage even when using a 
fraction of the revs it would have pulled in it’s heyday. It is lighter than the 
cheapest Ford Focus but has more power than a new Ferrari F430.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>If there is a bright side to 
the XJ13’s status as the greatest "what if" in British motor racing history, it 
is that one of the most beautiful and fascinating cars ever built was never 
written off on the race track. And if you are incredibly lucky and very, very 
careful it can still be driven to this day. Just check your insurance 
beforehand!</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=3>

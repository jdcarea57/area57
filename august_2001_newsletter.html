<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The 
summer being well under way, hopefully many of you have been getting out and 
about in your cars at the various events over the past few weeks. However with 
one exception, I am still waiting to hear about them. By the time this reaches 
you, quite a few of our cars will have been to the new August Bank Holiday event 
at Enfield and the regular show at the Chigwell Police Ground. Although anyone 
attending National Day at Gaydon might disagree, the weather has been an 
improvement on last summer. I understand from Chris that attendance at Gaydon 
was quite low as the appalling weather on the Sunday kept away spur of the 
moment attendances.

ideal motoring roads of Wales.

October is the visit to the De Haviland Museum which is only a few minutes from

like to know numbers and also how many will be coming back to us for tea and 
cake.

CHIEFS KICK UP STINK OVER WORKERS&#8217; DEODORANT</FONT></STRONG></P></U>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Workers 
at car giant Jaguar are in a lather over a problem in the paint shop. Bosses 
discovered that some under-arm deodorants used by the men leave a powdery 
residue on new cars and could contaminate the gleaming paintwork. The quality 
assurance team at Jaguar's Halewood factory on Merseyside have been searching 
for a deodorant which does not contain aluminium oxide, the chemical that 
produces the residue. Jaguar says it takes product quality very seriously and 
paint shop workers have already volunteered to have sweat samples taken from 
their shirts to test the deodorant they use. If it is shown that aluminium oxide 
is present, the worker will have to shower and put on fresh 
clothes.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><STRONG><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS"><FONT 
size=1><FONT size=2>Jaguar bosses have gone a step further and tested more than 
25 deodorants to see if they contain the chemical. Only three brands passed the 
test, one of which was Asda's 99p For Men body spray. The supermarket has agreed 
to supply Jaguar with 3,000 cans of body spray for the hard-working paint shop 
technicians. Andy Adcock, Asda&#8217;s health and beauty general manager, said: "We're 
pleased to hear that our men's body spray is as easy on Jaguar's paintwork as it 
is on the under-arm."</FONT>

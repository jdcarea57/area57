<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had a very 
good turnout of members at our second July meeting, including Alan, returned 
from holiday, broken foot, toothache and rehearsals! He almost felt that he 
needed to re-introduce himself. We also welcomed two new members, Phil and Angie 
who we had met at Hoddesdon with their Mark IX. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Various people 
have been to an assortment of shows over the past few weeks; Rotary Show at 
Chigwell, the Redbridge Show and Matching Green. Hopefully if the nagging from 
Alan and myself bears fruit, there will be reports of these next time. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The show at 
Chigwell clashed with the invitation to the SS Register to the Whitewebbs Museum 
on Sunday 24th June. Eight of our cars were there on a really glorious morning, 
but unfortunately many of the EDVVS members had chosen to attend a nearby steam 
and car show. Even more disappointing was the fact that only two visiting SS 
register members came along. A lovely green SS90 was brought along by Brian 
Taylor (I hope I have the surname correct), and Nik Drukker was there with his 
SS 3.5, known to one and all as Myrtle, which was bought new by his father. 
Despite Nik having mentioned the visit in the Jaguar Driver and his making a 
couple of phone calls while we were there, no more SS cars appeared. Those of us 
who have been to the Museum many times can easily take it for granted and it was 
good to see how impressed Nik was with it. Luckily Dave and Penny Norton from 
the EDVVS came along with their Buick so he was able to tell Nik and Brian far 
more about the Museum than we could. The sunshine showed the cars off well and 
Phil took plenty of pictures. Hopefully, Nik&#8217;s will have turned out 
successfully and we may see good coverage of the visit in a future Jaguar 
Driver.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Ten of our cars 
made the annual visit to Hoddesdon Town Centre for the show there on 14th July. 
We had a different position for the first time. This year we were arranged 
around the war memorial at the other end of the High Street. I don&#8217;t know if 
this should be regarded as the most prestigious position as the Memorial Site in 
the Chelsea Flower Show marquee used to be, but for the number of cars we had, 
it was ideal. Although we had a little shower in the morning, the weather was 
quite good which I gather was certainly different from many other local areas. 
As usual, Keith and Audrey provided some after show refreshments in their lovely 
garden. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On the previous 
evening a couple of dozen of us went along to a quiz night to raise money for 
the centre that Dick and Eileen&#8217;s son attends. Fish and chips went down well 
midway through the evening, which was good fun, although some of the questions 
had us totally confused. One of our tables, however, managed to come third and 
another one had three winning raffle tickets. The final figures are not known 
yet, but it is thought that over £1,000 was raised.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>An item on the 
legal section of the Jimmy Young show amused me recently. A woman who had 
written in was going through divorce proceedings. She was the owner of an E-type 
which had belonged to her late father. It was in pretty bad condition when she 
inherited it. Her soon to be ex-husband had spent quite a bit of time and money 
on its restoration. While not disputing her ownership, he wanted the right to 
take it out to various car shows. It&#8217;s the first time I have heard of access and 
visitation rights applying to a car before! 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Coming up on 
5th August is the J.E.C. Show at Blake Hall. The meeting place for this is the 
Talbot car park on the A414 at 10 a.m. Please ring Alan on if you intend to meet there. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Don&#8217;t forget 
the Steam and Country Show at Holly Hill Farm on Enfield Ridgeway over August 
Bank Holiday. Our club display will be on the Monday only so please contact Eric 
if you wish to take part. 
<HR>

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>No doubt, 
several of you have received booking forms for the Chigwell Show on 2nd 
September. Pre-booking is not essential though.

<P><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><STRONG>From Classic Car 
Weekly - Wednesday 11th July 2001</STRONG></FONT></P></I>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Classic vehicle 
organisations cautiously await forthcoming legislation which could strictly 
limit the amount of oil that members of the public can buy, <STRONG>writes 
Richard Gunn</STRONG>. A draft directive from the European Commission's 
Directorate General for the Environment is due in the next few months governing 
the disposal of waste engine oil.&nbsp; Although the exact contents of the 
report are unclear at the moment, there are strong indications that a ceiling 
will be imposed prohibiting the sale of any more than one litre of oil at a 
time. "The logic behind this is that it would have the effect of limiting 
private persons to just topping up their oil." said BobTomlins, European Affairs 
Advisor of the International Historic Vehicle Organisation.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Commission 
sees individuals changing their oil as a serious source of pollution, with waste 
oil being tipped into drains etc."&nbsp; Although it is already illegal to 
dispose of oil in such a way in this country, there is little the authorities 
can do to enforce the rule, as it is a simple matter to throw waste material 
away in secret with little fear of being caught.&nbsp; With most engines 
requiring at least three litres of oil, the legislation could all but bring 
about an end to this aspect of routine home servicing of classic 
cars.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>However, there 
are fears that the directive could go even further, "A second likely response to 
the problem of tipping waste away could be to limit the sale of oil to private 
individuals only when they have used oil in exchange, as I believe has recently 
been introduced in the Netherlands," said Bob "This would also mean that oil 
could only be sold by licensed outlets that have facilities to handle the waste 
oil." "My belief is that, if this were to happen, it would result in the number 
of places where you could buy oil in reasonable quantities reducing 
considerably.  This would likely have a very severe effect on smaller and 
specialist suppliers, where you usually find specialist oils, such as those 
needed or preferred by many historic vehicle enthusiasts. Bob is optimistic, 
however, that any plans in the report affecting the rights of classic car owners 
can be changed before the legislation is passed. "When the draft directive is 
published," he said, "we will know how big a threat we are facing and we can 
plan our response and tactics accordingly.&nbsp; Based on the support from the 
European Parliament that we were able to secure over the End of Life Vehicles 
Directive, I am reasonably confident that if the Commission were to come up with 
some ridiculous proposals that seriously impacted on our interests, then we 
should be able to change them in the directive's progress through the European 
Parliament" </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2><FONT color=#0000ff>The 
legislation would also affect bigger retailers like Halfords, who could see 
their lubricant profits slashed.&nbsp; At the moment, the company sells 125 
million gallons of oil a year to the public through its 408 nationwide stores. A 
spokesman for the company said "Oil is an environmentally sensitive area, which 
is one of the reasons why Halfords has set up oil banks for used oil.&nbsp; If 
the legislation comes in, we will adhere to it, but we aren't aware of any 
impending legislation at the moment."</FONT>

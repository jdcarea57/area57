Run on 8th October at the Woodman, Nuthampstead. Barbara is taking names. Over 
the years our Breakfast Runs have been, and still are, very enjoyable. However, 
the numbers have dropped in comparison to earlier years, and there must be a 
point at which it is uneconomic for pubs to lay on the staff needed. So if you 
used to do these runs or haven’t done one before, why don’t you join us on 
October 8th. The meeting points are at 8 a.m at the Royal Forest Hotel, 
Chingford or opposite MacDonalds in Bullmoor Lane, Enfield.</DIV>

for the Christmas Dinner at Pearse House on 2nd December; details of menu and 
price will be in a later newsletter.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>About a dozen of our cars 
were at Trent Park on August Bank Holiday Monday, where the weather was mainly 
kind to us. It was the last occasion that we could enjoy Dave Norton’s relaxed, 
informative commentary on the cars as he and Penny are emigrating to Australia. 
They will be very much missed and Steve Brayshaw from the EDVVS presented them 
with a carriage clock as a thank you for all they have both done over the years.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>For the past couple of years, 
the Buntingford Show has been an occasion for Len and Sally to top up their 
suntans. Unfortunately, this year’s event had cloud and a cool wind so apart 
from an occasional wander up and down the street, we were all in our cars. As 
Doug and I were driving out, one of the organisers thanked us for coming, saying 
it was such a pleasure to see our row of E-types every year. A new addition this 
year was an event programme which featured our E-types on the cover.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I wish that I could take the 
credit for booking the weather as well as the hotel for the weekend in Norfolk, 
that seventeen of us enjoyed. It was wall to wall sunshine the whole time. The 
hotel was comfortable and relaxed with good food and the duty manager, 
Krystle/Crystal? (she didn’t tell us how she spelt it) made a hit with everyone. 
Inevitably with seventeen of us we couldn’t stick together all of the time but 
Swaffam, Collector’s World, Denver Windmill, Norfolk Rural Life Museum, 
Goodstone Water Gardens and Oxburgh Hall were among the places visited. It was 
nice to have Tom with us again and Phil and Heather came up from the West 
Country to join us for the weekend.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A surprisingly small number 
of us went to Croxley Green show on 17th September; just Alan and Barbara, Brian 
and Linda, Brian K and ourselves. It was a very enjoyable relaxed day with 
probably a thousand cars of all descriptions. There were lots of Jaguars, 
American cars, "funny" cars, everyday cars from the fifties and sixties; a real 
variety. A C-type and an Aston Martin DBR1 both looked really special even 
though they were replicas.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The Carter’s Steam Fair with 
their immaculate lorries and living wagons plus their rare steam powered rides 
also added to the day’s enjoyment. It was a shame that there wasn’t more of us 
to enjoy the excellent dodgems.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As a fairly informal, no 
pre-booking show with voluntary charity donations, it was a worthy addition to 
the calendar.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Dick received a letter from 
the organisers of the recent Little Haven Show, thanking us for our £40 
donation. Their total had not been finalised at the time of writing but it will 
finish at over £7,000. Next year’s event will be on 19th August but possibly at 
a different venue.

which I still have if anyone is interested.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#008000 size=2>Closing down 
Jaguar would provoke the biggest uproar in British industry for a generation. 
The meek disposal of Rover was accepted because the company had been a basket 
case for decades, in its death throes since some of the greatest names in 
motoring, Morris, Austin, Riley, Triumph were absorbed into an absurd state 
conglomerate and then hawked around the world to anybody who would take it, but 
Jaguar rose above all that, regained its independence and put some polish back 
on the Leaping Cat that has adorned the bonnets of some of the most beautiful 
cars ever made.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#008000 size=2>That is why 
Ford would attract abuse if it even countenanced disposing of a brand that ranks 
alongside Coca-Cola, the BBC and Rolls-Royce. Jaguar even owned by an American 
motoring multinational represents everything that is British, a byword for sleek 
power, fine craftsmanship and elegance. The E-type is a car that still defines a 
nation four decades after its launch and the new XK sports car springs from that 
rich heritage.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#008000 size=2>The problem 
lies with Ford. It bought the company ridiculously over-priced as part of a 
gung-ho spending spree, had to spend 20 years trying to update and streamline it 
and then decided to try to emulate BMW by venturing into the executive sales 
representatives market. But it did it with a car, the X-type, that was too 
conservative in styling, too meek in its approach. The result? Apathy among 
buyers who could see no reason to change from BMW or Audi.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#008000 size=2>In between, 
Jaguar was almost the last executive carmaker to introduce diesel engines, the 
fastest-growing sector anywhere in the marketplace. lan Callum, Jaguar's head of 
design, says that it takes five years to turn around a car business; the creator 
of the Aston Martin DB7 and now the new XK sports car needs another five years 
to return Jaguar to its past glory. Ford has to give Jaguar that time or it will 
face the wrath of the British nation.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

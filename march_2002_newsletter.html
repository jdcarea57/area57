Breakfast Run on 21st April is filling up rapidly. She needs names and money 
(£5.50 per head in advance) if you wish to join this always enjoyable start to 
the season.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>I have been given details of 
a show held by the Chiltern Vehicle Preservation Group to be held at Stockwood 
Park, Luton on 9th June. They have classes for the same sort of variety of 
vehicles as at the Pageant. Entry is free for pre-booked vehicles but there is 
an entry charge on the day. The event has been running for eleven years and 
entry to the event also includes a collection of horse drawn vehicles and the 
Transport -Section of the Stockwood Park Museum. It is also the only day that 
the Vauxhall Heritage Centre is open to the public.

Alexandra Palace, 9th-10th March</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Report by Dick 
Rogers</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Having decided to attend on 
the Saturday, I then drew the short straw and took Eric with me (just joking 
Eric). We had to queue for about twenty minutes for tickets, the advertised 
price of which was £8, on the day, however, the price had risen to 
£9.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Sterling Moss opened the 
show, and in the main hall there were about forty classics for sale from 
dealers, taking up the space that normally houses trade stands and autojumble. 
There were also about eighteen private classics for sale. Stanley Mann, the 
Bentley dealer had put on a good display, however overall we were somewhat 
disappointed with the show and, after about three hours, decided we had seen 
everything there was to see, had some lunch, and departed.

February</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>By Heather 
Kendon</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>February 1st came in with 
gales and torrential rain, as many will remember from the news reports on 
television. There were many overturned lorries and numerous accidents. However, 
despite the weather we travelled down to Bristol to spend the weekend with our 
daughter Karen. We arrived safely at her house, only to wait outside for her 
return from work, Karen having also been delayed in traffic by the awful weather 
conditions. Some hours later Karen&#8217;s boyfriend Darren, arrived from London down 
the M4, and his words were "I have aquaplaned home".</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Our main reason for the visit 
was to accompany both of them to the Royal Bath and West Showground for the 
Bristol Classic Car Show. Karen had joined the local Morris Minor Club in 
Bristol to get to know the members and to have some help and advice to purchase 
a classic Morris Minor. With the help of the Chairman, Karen was able to 
purchase her dream car, a 1969 Morris 1000 2 door saloon, in snowberry white, 
with red interior.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>On Saturday which was a very 
wet and miserable day, the four of us set off in her Morris Minor for the show. 
Karen was to spend an hour or so helping to man her Club stand. The whole of the 
show was inside several large buildings, with tented walkways from one to the 
other, thankfully protecting us from the elements.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>The first building housed an 
extensive auto-jumble of all sorts. We parted company, Karen and Darren to find 
her Club stand in the second building, and Phil and myself to browse around the 
auto-jumble. Having looked around for some time Phil found some car horns for 
the Mark 7, and asked to hear their sound. A very loud sound echoed in this 
large building, and unbeknown to us Karen and Darren were just re-entering the 
building to find us. On hearing these noisy blasts Karen remarked "I bet that&#8217;s 
my Dad", and could not believe it when they found us purchasing the horns. 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We continued our tour 
together to the Club stands; lots had theme&#8217;s for which they were judged. A 
great deal of thought had gone into each one, and being inside they could be 
properly stage managed. Karen&#8217;s club stand had the members dressed in White 
Shifts with wings on their backs depicting angels. Their stand had a white fence 
surrounding billowing white clouds of crepe paper, with heavenly music playing 
in the background. In the centre an illuminated roadway, with a motorway sign 
"Scrapyard Heaven", led up a slope to an archway with pearly gates under which 
sat a Bulldog adorned with a halo. Amongst the clouds were parts of Morris 
Minor&#8217;s in a very sad state, including half a rusted Morris, the back end of 
another, all depicting a tableau of Heaven for Morris Minor&#8217;s. The whole effect 
was extremely well done, and attracted a lot of interest. They were judged 
second. The Volvo stand with members dressed as Vikings came first. Having had a 
good day and with tired feet we returned back to Bristol, the weather having 
improved just a little. Karen&#8217;s little car managed all the hills, although a 
little slower than our Jag might have done. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Karen is attending 
maintenance classes so that she can carry out most of her own repairs and 
maintenance. This has however resulted in a few calls recently to Dad for a bit 
of help. Karen is looking forward to many happy miles in her little car if and 
when we have some summer.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>We departed Bristol on the 
Sunday after having lunch in a nice country Pub in that elusive sunshine. 
However, on reaching Swindon we were back to torrential rain for the rest of our 
journey home.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>It was a good weekend, 
different and interesting, only we were disappointed that there was an empty 
stand where the Jaguars should have been.</FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Thanks to Dick, I have got 
details of several museums that could be of interest to visit at some point in 
the future. The best known of these is the Heritage Motor Museum at Gaydon, 
Warwickshire&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.heritage-motor-centre.co.uk/">www.heritage-motor-centre.co.uk</A> 
. The Muckleburgh Collection of Military Vehicles&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.muckleburgh.co.uk/">www.muckleburgh.co.uk</A> is at Holt, 
Norfolk. Closer at hand are The Oxford Bus Museum&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.oxfordbusmuseum.org.uk/">www.oxfordbusmuseum.org.uk</A>&nbsp; 
near Witney, Oxfordshire and the Chiltern Museum of Motoring near Aylesbury. The 
one that seems to have the widest appeal is again in Norfolk at Downham Market, 
so not as far as the one at Holt. The Collectors World of Eric St John 
Foti&nbsp;<A href="http://www.collectors-world.org/">www.collectors-world.org</A> 
has an exhibition of Victorian England’s Shops, sights and sounds as well as a 
collection of Armstrong Siddely cars, carts, carriages, household and farming 
memorabilia, a Nelson room, a Barbara Cartland room, the Swinging Sixties, 
radios, dolls and dolls prams and a telephone museum.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I asked at the Gunpowder 
Mills, Waltham Abbey, <A 
href="http://www.royalgunpowdermills.com/">www.royalgunpowdermills.com</A> a 
couple of years ago about group booking but at that time they were only mid 
week. However, I have followed up this enquiry after Dick passed on an up to 
date leaflet and group discounts are available at weekends when all their 
special events are held in addition to the normal exhibits. They are holding a 
60th Anniversary of VE Day on 7th and 8th May but there are various events 
throughout the year.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Doug recently raised the 
possibility of a visit to the Shuttleworth Collection&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.shuttleworth.org/">www.shuttleworth.org</A> near Biggleswade, so 
I have been finding out a bit more about that. Some interest was expressed in 
the Military Pageant Air Display on Sunday 5th June. Apparently they never have 
final confirmation of participating aircraft until a week or two before hand but 
they would be first and second world war planes and possibly some foreign ones 
as well. Although we would be able to book as a group and have an allocated 
space they can’t offer discount on the £15 per adult price on these occasions. 
the reason being that they have to rope off an area, have directions to it etc. 
Space is always at a premium at these events so they would have to be paid a 
couple of weeks in advance as they have been let down in the past by group 
booking a space for fifty, having only twenty turn up, leaving members of the 
public not able to get in. You may have noticed in the Jaguar Driver that XJ Day 
is being held there on 26th June but nothing is flying on that day.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The club has been sent the 
date of a British Sports Car Day at Brooklands&nbsp;<A 
href="http://www.brooklandsmuseum.com/">www.brooklandsmuseum.com</A> on 17th 
July, a change from their previously advertised date of 19th June. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>One other date I have been 
given by Richard is on 3rd July for a fete at Bramfield near Hertford, which he 
says has been enjoyable in the past.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I will finish this month with 
a medical bulletin. Brian Kingsley and Ron Risk are both progressing well and 
are back at club meetings and Ron tells me that Pam is not using sticks anymore. 
At the time that these three were having operations, I had not realised Karen 
Smart was having her share of medical problems. A long term kidney stone problem 
has yet to be resolved but Karen has now been able to return to work. I hope it 
all gets sorted eventually and that everyone continues to make good progress.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On Tuesday 8th Feb. myself, 
Eric and Keith went to the Classic Car Evening at the famous Ace Cafe <A 
href="http://www.ace-cafe-london.com/">www.ace-cafe-london.com</A> . I took the 
MK2. We had a nice meal and were surprised at the amount of classics that turned 
up, ranging from MGs of the ‘60s going back as far as a 1926 Morris Commercial 
truck belonging to a London College.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The highlight of the evening 
was a Le Mans type Jaguar racing car.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The event takes place on the 
2nd Tuesday of the month all year round. If anybody wants to go next month we 
leave my house about 6.30 p.m. or we meet there.

KINGSLEY</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#800000 size=2>Dear Fellow 
members and colleagues,</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#800000 size=2>May I take this 
opportunity to thank all of those people who came to see me in hospital. Also 
phoned me to wish me well, and brought me fruit, sweets, drinks and cake that I 
am still trying to eat to this day.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#800000 size=2>For those 
people who don’t always get to every meeting and maybe were not aware of my 
situation; Just to say I recently had a triple by-pass operation for the heart 
at the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital, Uxbridge, Middlesex.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#800000 size=2>Due to the 
operation I cannot drive for six weeks. Thanks to those who offered to take me 
out for a ride, Dick had offered but had a bit of the flu. So I went up to the 
Goat on Sunday with Keith, had a pint and met up with Wayne and Richard with 
their Bentleys. Went back to Keith’s for dinner. Thanks for the roast lamb 
Audrey. Also Keith offered to bring me along to the club meet on the following 
Monday.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#800000 size=2>So once again 
thanks to Alan and Barbara, Doug and Wendy, Keith and Audrey, Ron and Pam, Len 
and Sally, Dick and Eileen, John and Penny, Wayne and Vicky.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#800000 size=2>Some time ago I 
joined a car club because of my interest in Jaguars. I am pleasantly surprised 
to find I also gained an excellent family.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000080 size=2>When Peter 
Sidebottom's only son was killed in a car crash, it was months before he could 
bear to look at the classic Jaguar they had been restoring together. But five 
years on, with refurbishment of the £70,000 1951 XK120 coupe complete, Mr 
Sidebottom is raffling it for charity. The 62-year-old property developer from 
Wiltshire is hoping to raise £250,000 for the Child Bereavement Trust, which 
provides counselling for parents after a tragedy. About 125,000 tickets at £2 
each are being sold and the draw takes place on May 8 at the Badminton horse 
trials in Gloucestershire. The Child Bereavement Trust is the event's nominated 
charity for this year.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000080 size=2>Mr Sidebottom 
said: "Harry's two passions in life were horses and sports cars. It seems a 
fitting memorial to him to raise money for a bereavement charity by raffling the 
very special car we were building together for him." </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000080 size=2>Harry, 24, was 
killed on September 5,1999, near the family home. Mr Sidebottom had to break the 
news to his ex-wife Flappy - Harry's mother - who was abroad at the time. He 
said: "Even at the awful time I was being told about Harry's death, I was struck 
by how sensible, calm and instructive the young police constables were. I was to 
learn later that they had been schooled by the Child Bereavement Trust." 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000080 size=2>Mr Sidebottom 
and his former wife became deeply involved in the charity's work, with Harry's 
mother raising £600,000 to set up and run its bereavement helpline in 2001. 
Money raised from the car raffle will keep the helpline staffed for a further 
two to three years. Mr Sidebottom added: "The charity saved our lives after 
Harry was killed, it gave us hope. Now I want to help others." </FONT></P>

will be on 18th March at 8 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to other commitments Alan 
Collins has not been able to attend recent meetings so if there are any matters 
that you need to raise with him about the club, you will need to ring 
him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget to make use of your voting slips&nbsp;for this 
year&#8217;s John Dyall Trophy, which will be awarded at the A.G.M. for services to 
the Area during the past year.

To The Fifties Day at Waltham Cross on Saturday 8th June which is being 
organised by the Borough of Broxbourne. They do say that space is limited but I 
don&#8217;t know whether it is limited to 1950&#8217;s cars.

<P align=justify>A new computer based paint matching service is available at Car 
Spares, Delamare Road, Cheshunt, EN8 9AP. All you need is a sample panel from 
the car (minimum size about 5 inches square and more or less flat). The computer 
looks at a photo of the colour, mixes the correct sample which is sprayed on to 
a card, is allowed to dry and both the sample and the panel are compared to 
ensure a correct match. This is again done by the computer. The cost (at time of 
writing) is £25 plus paint. The contact is Bob on 
01992-635585.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>

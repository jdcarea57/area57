usual but apologies for absence were received from several people. Area Rep. 
Alan Collins thanked us for coming and it was agreed that the minutes of last 
year’s meeting should be taken as read.</FONT></DIV>

<P align=justify></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">As usual, Alan gave us a 
brief run through of events, social gatherings etc. that had taken place over 
the past year. The Enfield Pageant is always the main event and he thanked Eric 
for his organisation, Clockhouse Nursery via Keith Oswick for floral 
decorations, and the cooking squad for the always enjoyable bacon rolls. The 
Hoddesdon Show and Trent Park are also EDVVS events that we supported. Despite 
dreadful weather, the Harpenden show was still well supported. Apparently the 
show at Waltham Cross was only small and the Enfield Town Show and Chigwell 
didn’t get very enthusiatic reports. We fitted in three Breakfast Runs this 
year, the two usual ones at Rickling Green, plus an extra at the Woodman at 
Nuthampstead. We hope to do the same this summer. The EDVVS had a weekend in the 
New Forest which was enjoyed by Keith &amp; Audrey and Dick &amp; Eileen. The XK 
Register weekends were in the Witney area, Stamford/Peterborougn and Portsmouth. 
The Goodwood Revival meeting got glowing reports from Richard Freestone and Dick 
has continued to visit the Ace Cafe regularly. One of our most recent outings 
was the interesting trip to the Highways Agency at South Mimms that Keith Oswick 
organised for us. Keith Williams and Brian Kingsley both celebrated their 60th 
birthdays and several of us helped Tom celebrate his 80th. Eileen’s cake for 
Brian was appreciated. The Christmas dinner at Pearse House was enjoyed by 
everyone. Obviously I may have missed out some places, so apologies if I’ve left 
out anything that you attended.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Alan closed by thanking everyone in 
the Area for their support and friendship.</FONT></P>

pay for the food at our 20th celebrations.</FONT></P>

that people do read it and contribute to it.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Roy Fludgate reported that we have 
had two lapsed memberships, however through the web site we have gained two new 
members. There are currently 41 memberships representing 61 people and 69 
vehicles. There have been plenty of hits on the web site and the Club Calendar 
is updated more regularly than the Newsletter of course.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Election of 
Officers</FONT></P></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The election of officers caused more 
discussion than usual as Alan felt that some people were of the opinion that he 
might wish to take a break after fifteen years. As has happened before there was 
no-one else who wished to take on the post. Alan has put in a lot of commitment 
over the last fifteen years which we all appreciate. However, the way in which 
we have organised the club over it’s entire twenty years means that it has never 
been a one man show or even one in which decisions are made by the committee. 
All members have always been free to suggest anything about the club’s 
organisation, outings etc. so nothing would change if Alan were to stand down. 
It was then unanimously agreed that Alan would continue as Area Rep., supported 
by Barbara Collins, Wendy Shipman and Roy Fludgate. As Phil and Heather Kendon 
hope to move, Brian Kingsley has agreed to take over the positon of Club 
Archivist. Please remember to take photos for the Club albums, with the date and 
place on them.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">There was only one matter raised 
under ‘Any Other Business’. In the past voting for the John Dyall Trophy has 
been for services to the Area over the past year. It has been agreed that in 
future this will be awarded for general help to the Area regardless of a current 
year. Alan also mentioned that the people who bother to vote has declined, so 
maybe this may make it easier.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It only remained for Alan to thank 
everyone again for twenty good years.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">As has been mentioned in past 
Newsletters, it has been decided that our 20th anniversary would be an 
approriate time to support the JDC’s 50th. If you read the March issue of the 
Jaguar Driver, you will have seen that the event has moved. It will now be held 
at Eynsham Hall, North Leigh near Witney. It is on the A4095 between Bicester 
and Witney. Dick has been in contact with Nid Drukker who says we can have an 
area for parking together. Please let Alan or Dick know by the next meeting (3rd 
April) if you want to go so that Nik knows how much room to reserve for us. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Mick Duffy, chairman of the XK 
Register, has contacted Alan to say that our support would be appreciated at XK 
Day on 30th July at Burghley House, Stamford. This is the final day of 
International XK weekend, during which we always enjoy a country drive on the 
Saturday. Last year other car clubs were invited and all cars park together, not 
XKs and others. Burghley House is a very impressive stately home and the 
Orangery Restaurant provides good food, both hot and cold. The Register gets 
excellent support from local Jaguar dealer, Marshalls of Peterborough who will 
bring along new cars to try.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Alan has details of a parade of cars 
in the Westminster area on 16th July, contact him if interested.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Dick has said that anyone is welcome 
to join him at the SS meeting at Potters Crouch on 10th July. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Chilterns Area have a change of 
venue for their Area day this year. It is at the Buckingham Railway Centre on 
2nd July. Shuttleworth is the setting for XJ Day again on 11th June which this 
year is a flying day. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Brian K. has passed on some leaflets 
from the Chelmer Valley Car Club which may be of interest to those of you in the 
Essex direction. They are holding a Classic Car Show in conjunction with the 
Weald Park County Festival on 17th-18th June, and Classics On the Common at the 
Horse and Groom, Galley Wood Common on Wednesday 12th July. I have an entry form 
for the first of these and 01245-268157 is the number to ring for Classics on 
the Common. 
<HR>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Harpenden Classics on the Common 
meeting had been in some doubt but I gather it is going ahead although I have 
not been given a date. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I have just booked a weekend away at 
Broom Hall Hotel near Thetford for 8th and 9th September. The hotel only has 
fifteen rooms and we already have over half of these so please contact me if you 
want me to see if there are any more rooms available.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I apologise for putting the A.G.M. 
date wrong in the January Newsletter but it was correct in the Calendar and the 
February 
Newsletter.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

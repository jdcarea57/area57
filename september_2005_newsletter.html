<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The last few weeks seem to have been 
fairly active, starting with the show near Burnham that Dick has reported on for 
me. As agreed, the £40 raised at the Pageant from the sale of the floral 
displays was given to the Little Haven Children’s Hospice.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The weather for the Trent Park Show 
was considerably better than last years and we had a pleasant relaxing day in 
the sunshine after the obligatory bacon rolls. Quite a few of us did several 
parades around the arena accompanied by Dave Norton’s usual knowledgeable 
commentary. Barbara and Loraine managed to spend a considerable time satisfying 
their shopaholic needs. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The Buntingford show on September 
3rd was again sunny; not as hot as last year but there was a sunny side of the 
street for Len and Sally. Their car was chosen as second in the category for 
Best Condition Car. There was a wide variety of cars although generally not too 
many oldies. In the back of a "Funny" car which I think started life as a Ford 
Popular was a sign saying "Get In, Sit Down, Hold On and Shut Up". The motor 
bike fraternity was very well represented. Two live bands were playing and I 
understand that one heavy rock band attracted a very young fan who not only 
played "air guitar" but "air saxophone" as well. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The next day we tried a new venue 
for a Breakfast Run. Apologies to anyone who may not have heard about this in 
time. We had a very enjoyable breakfast at The Woodman, Nuthampstead, near 
Royston. It was a glorious morning for a drive and everyone seemed very 
impressed with the breakfast, so I would think there will be another visit there 
at some time. Some people had a busy day and went on to either the Goat or the 
Capel Manor Show afterwards. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Our return visit to the Corse Lawn 
Hotel near Tewksbury was very successful. Unfortunately, I didn’t book the good 
weather as well, but I gather we were better off there than at home. While 
enjoying some lovely sunshine on the Friday afternoon, Keith and Audrey had a 
phone call from Laura to say their dog was scared of the thunderstorm. That was 
the last sunshine we had however and our visit to Worcester on Saturday had 
showers and cloud. Luckily only cloud while we had a boat trip along the River 
Severn. There were sixteen of us this year, more than we have had for a long 
time, if not ever, so we tended to split up into smaller groups after that. Some 
of us snapped up some bargains in the Royal Worcester Seconds Shop. Our 
sympathies went to Keith and Bobbie who had a call informing them that that they 
had been burgled. On Sunday morning most of us went to Hidcote Manor Garden, 
driving through some pretty Cotswold villages on the way.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">This was the first time that Alan 
and Barbara had been able to join us since way back, and they were as impressed 
with the hotel as the rest of us were last year. It was Eric and Margot’s first 
visit as they were away last year and it got the thumbs up from them as well. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I think Brian Kingsley was our only 
representative at the Enfield Town Show and Croxley Green this year, and Dick 
had a good evening at the recent Classic Car night at the Ace Cafe. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Richard Freestone was extremely 
enthusiastic about the Goodwood Revival Meeting which has been running for about 
five or six years now. The revival theme extends to the spectators, with period 
costumes much in evidence. Hopefully some of you saw the one hour programme 
about the weekend on Sunday 25th on ITV. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Margot has recently given me an 
article about actress Daryl Hannah’s trip to Belize to see the work of the World 
Land Trust. The trip was made possible by Jaguar Cars; the company has supported 
the Programme for Belize for 25 years, funding conservation projects and helping 
to set up the Cockscomb Basin Jaguar Reserve.

Althorne in Essex near Maldon. We arrived in sunshine and it stayed that way all 
day long. Ron and Pam, Brian, Keith, Bobby and Keith’s mum, Keith and Audrey, 
Alan and Barbara, Eric and Margot, Eileen, Martin and myself all enjoyed a 
pleasant day. Things to do or see ranged from Belly Dancers, Singers, Horses, 
Dogs, Motor bikes, Cars, Tractors, Stalls and a garden to look around, plus a 
garage full of memorabilia. I would like to thank everyone for going and let you 
know that the show raised about £5000, more than double last year’s amount.

birds of prey, police dogs and children’s entertainment.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The police helicopter was open to 
the public and after the dog display you could go and talk to the police and 
fuss the dogs. They had the smallest police dog in service, she sniffs out 
explosives and they had a dog sniffing out drugs.</FONT></DIV>

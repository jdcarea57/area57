<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">The season now being 
over, we are looking forward to the re-arranged Christmas Dinner at the Plough, 
Cattlegate Road, (7.30 for 8 p.m). At the time of writing, there is room for one 
more couple, so contact Barbara if you would like to attend.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">While on the subject 
of food, I forgot to mention the Breakfast Run in last month&#8217;s Newsletter. It 
was one of the few wet mornings we have had for these runs however, as we were 
using the E-type, we managed to stay dry. Tim and his team seemed to be very on 
the ball and supplies of toast, tea and coffee kept re-appearing. As usual most 
of us took advantage of Alan and Barbara&#8217;s hospitality for more refreshments 
afterwards.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know how many 
shows or events members attended this year, but with the exception of the ones 
Doug and I went to, which I have already written about, I was given the grand 
total of three reports! A few newspaper cuttings and other articles were also 
passed on, for which I am grateful, but it really would help to have a few lines 
from other members about the shows you go to.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">Balmoral Knitwear have 
now added T-shirts to their range and the people who have ordered them expressed 
the opinion that the quality is very good. The price (with our embroidered logo) 
is £5.05, a bargain if ever there was one. Balmoral now charge postage which I 
will split evenly between the number of garments ordered, so there may be a 
slight variation in the cost at different times.

CHESTERFIELD - 28th-30th September</FONT></P></B></U>

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">Report by Eileen 
Rogers</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">It was decided by the 
XK Register to resume the annual XK weekend with a presentation dinner on 
Saturday night. Unfortunately Doug and Wendy Shipman with their XK120 were 
unable to go at the very last minute (morning of departure). Doug had an 
extremely bad cold and was very sadly missed, so only two XKs set off on Friday 
morning, making their way to Chesterfield in Derbyshire. The occupants of the 2 
XKs were Eric Tetsell with friend John, and Dick and Eileen Rogers. The usual 
refreshment stops were made along the way; a very nice inn called The Blue Cow 
in Lincolnshire can be recommended.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">We arrived at the 
hotel in time for afternoon tea. The Ringwood Hall Hotel is under new management 
and is undergoing restoration, but we were made to feel extremely welcome by the 
friendly staff. There were about 20 Xks for the weekend, with their owners of 
course!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">Saturday morning we 
set off on the rally with our hood down despite a bit of drizzle. This proved to 
be a mistake however. Several miles down the road, in the midst of the beautiful 
Derbyshire countryside, torrential rain descended upon us. By the time we had 
our hood up we were soaked to the skin.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">The village we stopped 
at for lunch had an old-fashioned cheese shop and nearly everyone made purchases 
there. As we went back to our cars parked at the side of the road an excited man 
asked us to wait as his friend who lives close by was driving into the village 
to look at the cars. She had one of her own in Switzerland. We obliged and 
stayed chatting for ages.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">The XK presentation 
dinner took place back at the hotel, and Eric Clowe was presented with the 
chairman&#8217;s trophy, Rose Eaton won the Stuart Lightfoot Trophy and, lo and 
behold, Eric Tetsell won the free weekend for two, and believe it or not, he was 
speechless. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">On 18th October I was 
asked by a friend to look at a Mk V Jaguar Saloon 1950 with a 2.5 litre 
engine.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">We had already looked 
at 2 albums of restoration photos and we were told that only the woodwork was 
left to re-veneer in order to complete the car.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">At the crack of dawn 
(6.30 a.m. to be precise), we set off in the rain down to meet the hovercraft, 
which only takes 10 minutes to reach the Isle of Wight. We met the two brothers 
who owned the car and travelled by Ford Probe at a rapid pace through to 
Shanklin. The barn was opened and that is when things started to go 
wrong;</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">The restoration had 
been an on-going project since 1994, so we expected to see a nice car, however 
the car had not been started for about 4 years, so the garden mower battery that 
they connected up was not going to start it. The chrome work we were told had 
been re-chromed but it was all rusty and peeling off. The tyres were van type 
with deep treads, a bit like Town and Country. The wings had been off but were 
all red rust on the underside. The bonnet did not fit. The head lining was made 
from an old table cloth. The doors were rusty at the bottom. The seats were the 
best part of the car as they had been re-leathered as were the door panels. We 
decided to leave the car, and got a lift back to the hovercraft. Before coming 
home we had fish and chips and an ice cream. (Thanks Keith for a good day 
out).</FONT></P>

with the car,&nbsp;but has subsequently bought a nice Daimler

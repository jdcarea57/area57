<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the Mince Pie evening, I 
had more chance to get people&#8217;s opinion of the Christmas Dinner at the Old 
Manor. The general view was pretty favourable so thanks to Keith Oswick for 
suggesting it. Barbara had done her usual good job of getting people&#8217;s choices 
organised before hand and thanks also to Loraine for printing our individual 
menu cards. Although the Wyllyotts Manor building has been altered considerably 
over the years, parts of it do go back to the sixteenth century. I have included 
an article from a Potters Bar Community News magazine about the man who appears 
largely responsible for the present appearance of the building.

March. It is likely that Alan will not be at any meetings before this, so if you 
have any matters regarding the club or its officers, please give him a ring 
before then. Don&#8217;t forget that it is nearly time to vote for the next winner of 
the John Dyall Trophy.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Eric tells me that he has 
booked our space at the Enfield Pageant at the end of May, so hopefully we will 
be able to put on our usual good display. If those of you who normally have your 
cars on show, could put relevant information about your car on a small display 
card for the benefit of show visitors, it would be helpful.

<P align=justify><B><I></B></I><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Recently Ron 
was working in his garage on his E-type hooter button. He had it dismantled and 
was using a circuit tester on it. As he touched the button he heard "Hello". He 
thought that&#8217;s funny, where did that come from? He touched it again. "Hello". He 
couldn&#8217;t believe it, and tried it again "Hellooo!" He thought he must be on to 
something now. After all his little conversations with his beloved E-type, had 
it finally learned to talk? With trembling fingers he touched it again 
"HALLOOOO". This time it was so loud, he realised it was coming from the top 
pocket of his overalls containing his mobile phone. Following a mesmerizing 
conversation with Brian Kingsley he had forgotten to turn his phone off and 
Brian was shouting to attract his attention to turn it off. This was actually 
better than a previous conversation where Ron had actually dropped off and was 
snoring till Brian shouted to wake him up. Sorry Brian!

<P align=justify><B><U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>LOCAL PEOPLE FROM THE 
PAST - Arthur Hugh Seabrook (c.1875-1949)</FONT></U></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><U></B></U><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Hugh Seabrook 
was educated at the King Edward VI School, Chelmsford. He was very interested in 
mechanical and electrical engineering, gaining his first experience at the local 
Messrs. Crompton and Company's works from 1891 -1895. Following this he held the 
post of assistant electrical engineer at Great Yarmouth and then Hampstead. In 
1900 he became the engineer and manager at the Barking and Bickton Light 
Railway, which included an electrically operated lifting bridge over a river, 
all part of the light railway system operated by the council. By 1907 he held a 
similar position at the West Ham Corporation. It was while there that he was a 
pioneer in supplying electrical power at low prices. Two years later he was 
appointed borough electrical engineer to the St Marylebone Corporation, during 
which time he promoted the use of electricity in off-peak periods. Subscribers 
were encouraged to use electric heating and cooking </FONT><FONT 
face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>apparatus for domestic purposes. It is interesting 
to note that the great debate on the introduction of electricity to Potters Bar 
did not occur until 1924. In 1918 he resigned his position and entered into 
private practice.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From July 1923 he rented 
Wyllyotts Manor, and when Professor Beresford Pike examined it in that year, he 
described it as a 'medieval gem'. At the time and for a few years earlier it had 
been very badly maintained: a dirty farmhouse and barn with cabbages growing up 
to the door. However Mr Seabrook became so fascinated with its possibilities 
that he purchased it from the Brewers Company in 1925.</FONT><FONT 
face="Comic Sans MS" size=2></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Mr Henry Butcher, the local 
bank manager and historian did not approve of what Mr Seabrook did to create the 
present appearance of Wyllyotts. He regarded the house as a fake and warned Mr 
Seabrook that when he put in the front door and adjoining lean-to, took off the 
white plaster from the outside walls, bricked up between the posts and put in a 
fake fire place and gallery, he was doing the district a disservice in providing 
a lovely sixteenth century building. This was far from the truth, Mr Seabrook 
was a qualified man, one who had been elected a member of the Institute Of 
Mechanical Engineers in 1907 and was by that time already a member of the 
Institute of Electrical Engineers. He also read a paper to the London and 
Middlesex Archaeological Society on the 7th October 1925. in which he recorded 
what he had done concerning Wyllyotts: this paper was subsequently publishedin 
their transactions. He recorded that no sooner had he commenced clearing away 
the dirt and filth of the habitable portions did he realise its potential. To 
quote him 'from that day to this I have devoted practically all my spare time to 
repairing the house, but I estimate that it will take me from five to ten years 
to make it what I want it to be.' He noted in a most detailed account what he 
had observed and the alteration he had made. For example, after removing the 
previous weatherboard he put in personally all the present bricks with the 
exception of the brickwork found underneath the boards of bay 5, i.e. the low 
section between the two present buildings. Most of the bricks he used were found 
on the premises. He put in the lead lights and casements, which were removed 
only recently, these too were lying about the building. Therefore Mr Hugh 
Seabrook not only carried out a thorough restoration of the Wyllyotts at his own 
expense, but also left for posterity an attractive building. In 1937 the then 
Potters Bar Urban District Council purchased the premises with the object of 
securing the future of the mainly fifteenth century building. During the 1939-45 
war Mr Seabrook held for some years the position of garrison engineer 
(electrical and mechanical) under the Commander Royal Engineers, Northern 
Command. He died on the 2nd July 1949, at Southwold. in his seventy fourth year.

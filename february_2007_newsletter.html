<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Can I ask you again to ensure 
that you use your voting slip <EM>(which will be in the post)</EM>&nbsp;for your 
nominations for the John Dyall Trophy, awarded for services to the club. If 
there are any matters regarding the running of the Club that you wish to raise 
at the A.G.M. please contact Alan Collins beforehand. Similarly if anyone wishes 
to stand for any of the positions, again speak to Alan. I would also remind you 
that Alan has advised us of his intention to stand down as Area Rep. at this 
A.G.M. and we will therefore be needing someone to take his place.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The date for the first 
Breakfast Run of the year has been confirmed for April 15th at The Woodman, 
Nuthampstead, nr.Royston. Barbara is collecting names and £7.50 per head. They 
have provided very good breakfasts for us here in the past, so why not join us 
for a pleasant early morning run. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Eric already has passes 
organised for The Enfield Pageant over the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May 
so he will be needing names. Contact him&nbsp;to let him know whether you can 
show your car/cars on Sunday, Monday or both. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I have been given some dates; 
some of which are confirmations of provisional dates. There is a show at 
Battlesbridge in Essex on 13th May; Alan and Barbara have been to this one in 
the past so can probably tell you a bit more about it. John Clark has been told 
of a show at Cheshunt on 7th July. (020-8527-2706 for more details). A few years 
ago Alan and Barbara went to a show held on the farm in Kent where The Darling 
Buds of May was filmed; it is being held there this year on 15th July. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>One of the biggest car events 
of the year is the Classics on the Common show at Harpenden; a pre -booked event 
only. I gather that some people have already been E-mailed about this. The date 
is Wednesday 25th July. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I know it's only February, 
but I'm going as far ahead as August 19th with a mention of the show held near 
Burnham on Crouch in aid of Little Haven Children's Hospice. An enjoyable event 
and a good cause; Dick Rogers will be the contact for this nearer the time. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Alan made some enquiries for 
us about the possibility of going Tenpin bowling. Unfortunately there was not 
enough support for the idea and it also seemed that it would not have been 
possible to make a group booking on a Saturday evening. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Doug and I have managed to 
put together a quiz to be held on April 16th, which is a normal club night. It 
is part general knowledge and part Jaguars/motoring. All the questions are 
multiple-choice, so come along and join in. We have never held a Quiz Night 
before so hopefully it will make a change and be a bit of fun. There will be a 
prize for the winner. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I have an order for 
sweatshirts etc. started but I need at least two more items before I can send it 
off. If your Club clothing needs replacing let me know. I have always got the 
catalogue with me at Club meetings.</FONT><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"

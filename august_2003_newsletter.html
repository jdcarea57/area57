BUNKER - Sunday 10th August</FONT></DIV></B></U>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On what turned out to be the hottest 
day of the year quite a few of us visited the Secret Nuclear Bunker at Kelvedon 
Hatch. We had eleven cars lined up in the car park, which we were later walking 
under apparently. Apart from the interest of the visit most of us were grateful 
for the 60 deg temperature underground. We left Len and Sally Smerald to roast 
themselves at Regulo 90 something, hopefully with frequent basting of sunscreen. 
Down below we were given the audio guides to follow the numbered trail around 
the site. Alan Collins' commentary didn&#8217;t seem relevant to what we were seeing; 
not surprising as it was from the Palace of Westminster!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">A fascinating visit took us 75 feet 
underground where three storeys housed more than 110 tons of equipment and up to 
600 Government personnel. The bunker had its own water supply, electricity 
generators, BBC studio, radar room and the room where scientists would be able 
to plot the fall out patterns from any nuclear attack. To really take in all the 
information provided by photos, maps, videos etc. would take many hours but it 
was an eye opener to see how serious the powers that be felt the cold war 
situation was back in the early fifties when this was built, and it was 
certainly worth a visit.

CHARITY RUN - Sunday 27th July</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Report by Keith 
Oswick</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">This event is organised by the South 
Eastern Vintage and Classic Vehicle Club with the sponsored proceeds raised 
going to Great Ormond Street Hospital and St. Dunstans organisation for blinded 
ex-servicemen or women. About £4,800 was raised on the day. Several cars met at 
the Whitewebbs Museum on an overcast morning for the start of this event and 
were presented with complimentary t-shirts, baseball caps and balloons and 
running plaque courtesy of the main sponsors. Excellent route directions were 
supplied for a lovely scenic country route to the halfway stage at the Basildon 
Eastgate shopping Centre which was approximately 34 miles. We were greeted by a 
3 piece jazz band, complimentary cup of coffee and a heavy shower of rain, but 
nevertheless spirits were not dampened. Wayne and Vicki Blackburn were there in 
their Rover P4. The rain stopped, the sun came out and a good selection of 
vintage and classic cars continued on the 2nd stage to Southend via country 
lanes , another 34 miles. Excellent reception at Southend upon our arrival with 
a section of the front promenade from the Casino closed to normal traffic for us 
to park. About 130 cars paraded along the seafront. Sun, sea and sand welcomed 
us, the atmosphere was great with quite a few people dressed in period costume, 
including "John Lennon" and "Rod Steward" lookalikes. A Jazz band and Classic 
Gold Radio supplied the music which had several people "dancing in the street". 
There were several awards with the furthest travelled entrant from Dublin and 
one from Spalding. Car of the show went to a Packard. There were several special 
awards with a medallion on a ribbon presented to Dick, Eileen and Martin Rogers 
for their MK2. All prizes and awards were presented by Peter Aimes M.P. for 
Southend &amp; District. A good day out.

CENTENARY CELEBRATION - Sunday 3rd August</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Report by Keith 
Oswick</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Penny and John Wilkinson organised a 
collection of cars and the mobile shop from the EDVVS. John&#8217;s MK2 240 and my 
Daimler 250 were amongst the 15 cars on show. We had a good position in the park 
under the trees as shelter and shade from the sun, as it turned out to be very 
hot that day. The show was organised by Enfield Council to promote the proposed 
restoration of Broomfield House which was severely damaged by fire about 12 
years ago, by organising guided tours of the building with information desk and 
details etc.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Broomfield Park Model Boat Club had 
a nice collection of model boats on show with lots of detail that took many 
months to complete. I noticed that only sailing and electric powered boats were 
using the lake so when I enquired I was informed that internal combustion engine 
boats were not allowed on the lake and steam powered boats have to have annual 
boiler inspections and certification like traction engines and railway engines 
so not many people build them anymore. One tennis court was being used by remote 
controlled model cars.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Elsewhere there were puppet shows 
and teddy bears picnic shows for the children plus salsa dancing around the 
bandstand. There was also an "Its a Knockout" competition going on between 4 
teams of people. The funfair did not get going till after 2 p.m. The show was a 
free entry show so there was a steady stream of people looking at the cars and 
the mobile shop seemed to be busy. Overall it was a relaxing day out.

Wednesday 6th August CROXLEY GREEN (A mini Harpenden)</FONT></P></B></U><B><I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Report by Keith &amp; Audrey 
Williams</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">We had arranged to meet up with our 
friends (on what turned out to be the hottest evening of the year so far!) at 
Langleybury Cricket Club. Being local people they were able to lead us down 
beautiful county lanes to end up on Croxley Green near Watford.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">The hosts, Watford &amp; District 
Classic Vehicle Club, made us very welcome. During the evening some 800 old 
vehicles assembled on the green including a full range of classics, bikes, 
commercials, kit cars, American super cars and vintage cars. We thought we had a 
jet-propelled car there too but it turned out to be a Tatra with an incredible 
hi-fi system which when started up and shut down exactly mimicked a jet 
engine!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">My favourite exhibit was a 
collection of silver cross dolls prams dating from 1920. There was an 
appropriate doll for each pram and dressed in the correct style for that era. 
Two ladies in period costume pushed the prams up and down the aisles during the 
course of the evening.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P align=justify>Keith Oswick and Eric Tetsell arrived after work and joined our 
party for a quick drink! Admission was free but all donations went towards 
Watford Peace Hospice. A very worthwhile visit - will certainly do it again next 
year.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

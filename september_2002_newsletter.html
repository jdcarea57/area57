<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I can imagine that when those 
people who attended the Holly Hill Show on August Bank Holiday, received last 
month&#8217;s Newsletter mentioning a good forecast, there were some ribald comments. 
As it turned out it was a chilly, miserable day and those who had bravely turned 
up in shorts soon changed their minds. We told Loraine Clark that she looked 
like Nanook of the North. Now in it&#8217;s second year, the show seems to be getting 
good support. The combination of heavy horses, steam and classic cars does mean 
that there is plenty of interest. There was a small fair, mainly children&#8217;s 
rides but we had a go on the dodgems of course. Unfortunately they didn&#8217;t 
compare very favourably with the ones at Great Saling. We put on a display of 
nineteen cars and were later joined by an Austin Swallow.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>In complete contrast, the 
Chigwell Show six days later enjoyed absolutely glorious weather. Phil Kendon 
had asked the organisers if we could have a larger space than last year, which 
had been so cramped. We were given an embarrassingly large area on which we made 
a semi-circle of our ten cars. With such lovely weather it was a very pleasant 
day, but there is no doubt that this show is not what it was. It seems as though 
the fairground is getting larger every year. The amount of non M.G. cars has got 
smaller; there are less stalls of interest and the arena events are not what 
they were. The craft tents seem to have less in them and the country show aspect 
of having judged flower and vegetable, flower arrangements and handicraft 
competitions has disappeared altogether. While some aspects of the show&#8217;s 
decline can be put down to the fact that it is not the Metropolitan Police any 
more, much of it goes back further than their withdrawal. A friend of ours who 
has recently got involved with M.G.Bs attended for the first time and was 
surprised at the small amount of spares available at an M.G. show. As usual, the 
M.G. club sent over a judge to choose a favourite Jaguar. The ten year old 
daughter of Jan who does all the microphone work on the day, chose Phil and 
Heather&#8217;s MK VII. Apparently this little girl has lots of Jaguar books and is 
not interested in her dad&#8217;s M.G. She appeared to take her job seriously, walking 
around with a clipboard and writing things down.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I gather that the Hoddesdon 
style show at Buntingford on 7th September attracted about a hundred cars, but 
the East Anglian Day, at Stowmarket the next day, wasn&#8217;t very well supported. 
<HR>

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On Friday 13th, a dozen of us 
headed off to Hampshire to the Botley Park Hotel, which is roughly half way 
between Winchester and Portsmouth. It was nearly a weekend of trains and boats 
and planes. We had the first two but the nearest we got to planes was sitting 
chatting to a Harrods helicopter pilot. Apparently a business man had chartered 
the flight using the landing area at the hotel and then going to the Southampton 
Boat show. The weather was glorious, so we just sat outside till it was time to 
get ready for dinner. It has now become traditional on these weekends to have 
quizzes or games in the evening. On Friday night, Keith and Audrey Williams 
tested our nursery rhyme memories and I had organised some pictures of famous 
faces to be recognised. Quite a lot of frustration for people who couldn&#8217;t bring 
names to mind.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had hoped to go into 
Portsmouth on Saturday to see the Mary Rose, Victory or any of the other 
numerous places of interest. However, it turned out to be a special heritage 
weekend and everything needs pre-booking. Instead following the recommendation 
of friends of Tom and Enid Jones, we drove to Hamble and after a leisurely walk 
around the little village and a lunch break, we took a river trip along the 
Hamble river, passing millions and millions of pounds worth of boats moored all 
along. This was the area where the TV programme, Howards Way was filmed and the 
boat turned round at the riverside pub used in the series.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>When we got back to the hotel 
a game of petanque was agreed on, with girls taking on boys. Enid decided to go 
for a rest, so Tom had split personality playing for both sides. The girls 
won!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>After dinner that evening, 
Keith and Audrey tested some of our English knowledge, plurals, word meanings 
etc. from an old school book which was probably published in the forties or 
fifties. We had taken a game called Pass the Bomb which caused a great deal of 
noisy enjoyment. The next morning the boys took their revenge and beat the girls 
at carpet bowls. As this was played on bumpy grass it did tend to cancel out the 
effect of the bias of the bowl (and any skill of the players!)</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We said good bye to Tom and 
Enid who were heading home, and the rest of us went to Alton and a trip on the 
Watercress Line Steam Railway, a ten mile stretch using full size locomotives. 
Time for home then and the delights of the M25; Phil and Heather&#8217;s direction 
towards the Dartford Crossing being much better than the way the rest of us were 
going, with the usual crawl from junction 10 to past 16.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As usual, good company, 
pleasant surroundings and very good weather meant another enjoyable weekend.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Quite a few of us went to the 
Quiz Night on 6th September which was raising funds for the centre attended by 
Dick and Eileen Rogers' son. At an enjoyable evening with a fish and chip 
supper, the sum of £950 was raised.

<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Report by Dick Rogers</FONT></P></B></I>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>It was a fine day, and I arrived at about 
11:30. All the Morris Minors were parked in a separate field, so I parked along 
with a Daimler 250 V8 and a Series 1 XJ. There were some interesting pre-war 
cars on display, and also a lot of cars from Whitewebbs Museum were in 
attendance. A 1930s Austin won the prize for the best older car, and a 1960s 
Vauxhall Victor got the award in the Classic Car section.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I departed at about 4 o&#8217;clock and the 
weather turned wet about an hour later, but by then the car was back in the 
garage. (That was lucky, wasn&#8217;t it John?)</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT

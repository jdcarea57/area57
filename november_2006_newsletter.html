you booked in for the Christmas dinner at Pearse House on 2nd December, the time

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We had an excellent turnout 
at our last meeting which is always good to see at this time of year. Joining us 
was prospective member David Lawrence who, although living in Sussex, comes to 
Barnet regularly, so hopes to take part in some of our activities.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As I always say, it is 
difficult to find things to write about at this time of year, so Richard’s 
article about his last Bentley trip is much appreciated. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Eric and Keith W. have both 
been keeping me supplied with newspaper/magazine articles. I’ll try and précis 
pieces like this but will always have the relevant articles with me if anyone 
wants to read them properly. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From The Times - One of only 
four D-types left in immaculate condition was being auctioned at Coys this month 
and expected to fetch £2 million plus. It had been sold for £2,500 when it 
finished racing after finishing fourth in two Le Mans when driven by Paul Frere 
and Jacques Swaters. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>From the Sunday Times - 
Motoring correspondent Andrew Frankel was extremely impressed with the latest 
XK12 coupe and during the three days in which he had it, took every opportunity 
to take it out, and found it a perfect blend of point to point efficiency and 
character. The XKR shows that whatever the trouble at the top of Jaguar, the 
firm still has enough engineering talent to make up in clear thinking and 
inspired design what the company lacks in cash. Indications are demand will 
outstrip supply and it has been announced that the XKR will race at 
international level next year. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>The article that Keith passed 
to me is about someone having a bespoke MKII to all his own requirements 
including a 4.7 litre engine instead of 3.8. It doesn’t really lend itself to 
shortening this article but, as I mentioned, it will be in my case at club 
meetings if anyone wants to have a look. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I think most of us have found 
that our lives go in different phases over the years and thirty years ago Doug 
was very much involved with model engineering and built a small traction engine, 
two sixth scale ploughing engines and a quarter scale steam lorry. He recently 
decided to get the lorry running again to show our grandchildren. Before putting 
it away again for the winter, he mentioned at a club meeting that if anyone 
wanted to see it in steam they were welcome. As a result about thirteen people 
turned up on a Sunday morning to see it steaming. Unfortunately, because of very 
uneven paving due to tree roots, a chain broke but everyone seemed to find it 
interesting. It was such a lovely morning that we were able to have tea, coffee 
and cakes outside at the same time. I gather from Roy that there is now a 
picture of the lorry on our club website.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Greetings from Graaf Reinet, Eastern Cape, 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Been away for over 2 weeks now and having a 
wonderful time. We started in Ballito Bay in a real 5* place, Zimbali Lodge. 
Glad to get there as flight delayed ( 3 hours on the tarmac at Heathrow. Long 
haul is really the pits these days! </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Played golf on a very difficult course with 
loads of trees and undergrowth and between the four of us lost 25 balls!! 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Collected the car form Durban docks on 
28/9. Everything fine - all cars started. On 30/9 we headed for Mkuze. Pleasant 
drive thru great scenery to Ghost Mountain Inn. Went on two game drives but most 
animals in hiding. Saw Impala, gnu, kudu, heron, spoonbill, hippo &amp; crocs at 
a distance but no elephant or lion. On Monday 2/10 we set off for Swaziland. 
Delay at border but no real problems. Arrive at Piggs Peak hotel where Annie is 
waiting for me. Great drive in beautiful weather but next morning it's misty, 
cold &amp; wet. My mate Doug Salmon ( Speed 6) has broken a back spring taking a 
speed hump too fast. ( they are even more prolific than back home but many have 
no warnings). Spent most of the day helping him to get it fixed at a local agric 
machinery garage where they had all the heavy welding gear. On Weds 4/10 we set 
off for Natal Spa, Paul Pietersberg. Decided to have country walk with 5 others 
to alleviate some of the excesses of the last 10 days or so. All but me and one 
other slipped on stepping stones over a stream and ended up covered in black 
mud. Nobody injured &amp; very amusing for the rest of us. Done about 800 miles 
at that stage and B going well but doesn't like altitiudes ( 8000 ft highest so 
far). Fuel about 45p per litre and making about 13 mpg. On from there to 
Drakensberg mountains where we saw just about the best display of falconry ever 
. Eagles, hawks, vultures. Played pitch &amp; putt on a 6 hole coures and 
managed to lose 8 balls between the two of us! </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Next day we left for Lesotho. Quite a long 
drive with a very strong headwind in the morning. B running very rich and lack 
of power resulting in only 10 mpg. Weaken up the mixture after lunch and do a 
little better bur still not running right. The tour mechanics attend to it the 
next day and diagnose worn carburettor jets but do the best they can and full 
power retruned but still only 12 mpg-- good job the fuel's cheap here!! Job for 
when it's back home. On to Lesotho ( forgotten Kingdom). Extremely poor country. 
Weather really bad here. Almost continuous rain. Went out for lunch in back of 
Chris Wray's 4.5 and got drowned coming back in hail/thunderstorm. Now back in 
civilisation, Graaf Reinet and weather thankfully improved. many of the tour 
group have suffered with a two day flu thing but Annie &amp; I OK. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Hope y'all are well and will update you 
when I return home on 24/10. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Greetings from home, </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Arrived back Tuesday last week and have to 
admit it's been a bit tough getting back to normal. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Picking up from the last newsletter; 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>Having left Graaff Reinet, the next 
destination was a one night stop in Cradock a small town steeped in Victoriana. 
Overall the impression was a pretty poor area with vast unemployment amongst 
whites as well as blacks. However the accommodation was delightfully quaint in 
the form of self contained time warp cottages. That evening we were entertained 
in the local church by traditional African singing and dancing and a boys school 
choir. Next day an early start for a relatively long drive to Shamwari, the last 
10 miles or so on a dirt road. Took it very steady as didn't want to break 
springs or spokes. This place is a complete paradise consisting of realtively 
small game reserve with all the big six present, lion, leopard, elephant, hippo, 
rhino, giraffe + many others. It was a bit contrived as you're virtually 
guaranteed to see everything. Each ranger is equipped with network radio so they 
can alert each other when there is a "major sighting". The lions we saw were so 
close that as they sauntered past our Land Rover we could have reached out and 
stroked them ( not recommended )! We saw two Prides with cubs and it was really 
spectacular to say nothing of the elephants, giraffes, rhino all with calves. 
Fantastic! And so was the hotel - an all inclusive resort with luxurious 
apartments. The cost included 4 game drives and all food/ drink. Apparently the 
cost was £600 per couple per night. Very expensive but worth it if you want to 
see game. Next a short drive to Port Elizabeth where we had another two day 
stay. Nothing much to report here. Just a relaxing couple of days, serviced the 
car and swam in Indian Ocean. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>From there we had a longish drive to 
Knysna. A beautiful place where we had evening cruise/ dinner and some good old 
pirate songs. Chris Wray snapped his prop shaft but fortunately the tour 
organise, John White had a spare which was couriered overnight from Cape Town. 
Next we were on to Majiesfontein a staging post for the Blue train years ago. 
The hotel was called the Lord Milner. Again it was splendid Victoriana if a 
little run down at the edges but what atmosphere! There was a real boozers pub 
to which most had repaired by about 5-00pm as it had been a longish hot drive. 
Before long one of the staff started playing the piano and there was a singing 
riot up to dinner then more afterwards. A really great night of over indulgence 
for which I suffered aver the next 48 hours! So on to our final destination, 
Cape Town, where for a horrible hour or so I couldn't find my passport. After 
phoning the last few hotels to no avail we were just about to contact the 
British Consulate when Annie suddenly recalled she'd noticed it on the 
mantelpiece in the room on the morning of our departure from the Lord Milner at 
Majiesfontein when I was speaking to God on the big white telephone and stowed 
it in a pocket in her suitcase. What a relief. This is a very prosperous place 
with no end of building going on. Table mountain was spectacular but 
unfortunately Annie had to leave on Saturday evening to be back in time for work 
on Monday. It was great to meet up with Julia Howard whom those from EY might 
remember. Tall, beautiful blonde lady from Cape Town who worked alongside John 
Elder on 5th Floor Lintas House for a couple of years before returning to Cape 
Town in late 02. Julia has since married and has a 4 month old son, Tristram. I 
met her at breakfast on the Sunday which certainly started tongues wagging! 
Later that day drove to Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope ( managed to shoo the 
tourists away so I could get a good picture of the Bentley next to the sign) 
prior to all meeting up for a riotous lunch at Camps Bay, the home of the tour 
organiser. The farewell party on Sunday night was great fun and included Chris 
Wray, Marshall Bailey and several of the girls performing a hilarious song and 
dance routine about the tour, costumes and all. On Monday we drove the cars in 
to their containers and after fond and sad farewells set off for home.

<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000></FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#800000>For the anoraks, did 2510 miles averaging 
just under 13 mpg ( it should do a bit more than this and will have to overhaul 
the carburettors when it gets back). Used/lost about a quart of oil and no 
radiator water. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It is not often that I can mention a 
forthcoming event this late in the year. Over the years it has often been 
suggested that we visit the Stondon Transport Museum in Bedfordshire, but it has 
never actually happened. However, Dick and Eric recently visited it and we are 
hoping to go there on Sunday 14th November. Obviously it would be nice if the 
weather was kind enough to use Jaguars, but that can&#8217;t be relied upon. It is 
proposed that we have an early lunch at the nearby village of Shillington and 
then visit the museum. Eric has spoken to the landlord of the Crown who said we 
would be welcome at about 12 to 12.15. There is a lot to see at the Museum which 
has a collection of over 400 exhibits.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Our thanks to Keith Oswick 
for organising the trip to Southend on the "Waverly" paddle steamer. We were 
picked up from Enfield for the coach ride to Tower Bridge, where the boat was 
moored. Personally, I had never seen Tower Bridge open, so it was nice to be on 
the boat that it was opening for. Unfortunately it was rather a grey morning but 
not cold, so most of us stayed on deck for the three hour trip down the Thames 
with the various places of interest being pointed out by the commentary. For 
those of a certain age, it was interesting to see that the Radio Caroline boat 
is now moored on the Thames. Luckily the sun came out while we were at Southend, 
and after the almost obligatory fish and chips we headed for the funfair. I 
think Area 57 has been suffering from dodgem withdrawal symptoms this year, so 
we had a couple of turns on those. Most of the "boys" also had a go on the 
Go-Kart track, but the lack of driving skill of a little Japanese boy kept 
bringing everything to a halt. Our coach driver picked us up punctually for the 
return journey to finish off a really enjoyable day.</FONT></P>

members of the SS Register made another visit to the Whitewebbs Museum.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Our end of season Breakfast 
Run went well, the new A10 which had opened two days earlier meant that those of 
us from the Bullsmoor Lane meeting point had a good run. I think the general 
opinion was better than the April breakfast which was the first time the new 
owner had catered for us. As usual thanks to Barbara for organising it and the 
tea and coffee afterwards.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Earlier in the year I 
mentioned a couple of dates at the Ace Cafe. Since then, Eric Dick and Brian 
seem to have become regular visitors and apparently on a recent wet evening, 
there were about forty classic cars there, including some quite unusual 
vehicles.

<DIV align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I’ll start by wishing you 
all a Happy New Year and apologising for not giving earlier notice for an outing 
that Keith Oswick is organising for us on 6th February. There is a new motorway 
control centre at South Mimms (J23 of the M25) and Keith has made arrangements 
for us to go there at 8.00 p.m on Monday 6th February. This would normally be a 
club night so please don’t go to the Legion that evening.&nbsp;On reaching J23 
follow signs to the Services area and then park in the area for caravans.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>There have been enough people 
at the last couple of meetings to discuss the Club’s 20th anniversary 
celebrations. As you know from the last couple of newsletters, several ideas 
have been suggested, however we have eventually decided on a party at Pearse 
House (where we had our Christmas dinner) to be held on the evening of Saturday 
25th March. It was felt that it would be better to have somewhere exclusively 
for our use, as several people have said that they would like to be able to 
browse the Club photo albums, which we would be unable to do if we were amongst 
a lot of other people. At Pearse House we will also be able to show videos taken 
during the early years of Area 57. Foodwise, a running buffet was thought 
preferable to a "sit down dinner", as this would allow people to arrive when 
they like rather than at a specific time. On this occasion, it really would be 
nice to meet up with some of our less regular members whose names are familiar 
to us, but their faces less so. We’ll also be inviting some of our ex-members. 
The only cost involved will be for your drinks, as the Club will be paying for 
the venue &amp; food. Although it is going to be an informal affair, Alan needs 
to have some idea of numbers, so please contact him. Pearse House at Bishops 
Stortford is easy to find, and directions will be included with the next 
newsletter.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I’m sure most of you are 
aware that the JDC is celebrating 50 years in May and we hope to be able to 
arrange a space for our Area at Heythrop Park near Chipping Norton on 21st May. 
We haven’t been to many JDC events as a club lately so it’s a good opportunity 
to celebrate their anniversary as well as our own.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A few months back, I wrote 
that we do not seem to go to so many events en masse as we used to. This was 
emphasised by an old newsletter that Dick came across and it makes you realise 
that many of the old venues have now been discontinued. For many years we went 
to the Cancer Research Show in September at the Bald Faced Stag and also the 
MayDay Show at Stanborough Lakes. Neither of these now take place, and others, 
like the MG Club show at Chigwell, have deteriorated. Can I ask that this year, 
if you know of a show that you feel is worth a visit (particularly those that 
are not just car shows), please let Alan or myself know, so that we can 
publicise it and ascertain if anyone else would like to attend.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Barbara has booked the first 
Breakfast Run of the season to the Cricketers as usual, on Sunday 9th April, and 
has started collecting names. Call her&nbsp;for bookings.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Several people who were at 
Mince Pie night got involved in the quiz that Alan had from work. The joint 
brain power was very successful and his was the winning entry.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>This year’s A.G.M. will be on 
Monday, 20th March so start thinking who you think you’ll vote for to receive 
the John Dyall trophy.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Dick has given me the 
information about the charity show in aid of the Little Haven Children’s Hospice 
on Sunday 20th August at Althorne, Nr. Burnham-on-Crouch. Those who went last 
year really enjoyed it and obviously it’s for a very good cause. I expect that 
Dick will collect names nearer the time. He has also given me the date for a 
show a the Museum of Power at the Steam Pumping Station at Maldon on Sunday 11th 
June. I believe some people went to this show a couple of years ago.

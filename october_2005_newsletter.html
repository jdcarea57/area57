<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Many of you will be aware from the 
JDC Magazine that the Jaguar Drivers’ Club is celebrating fifty years next May. 
We at Area 57, also have an important anniversary in March as we will reach our 
twenty years This is an achievement that we intend to celebrate in some way and 
any ideas are welcome. Some of us were talking about it at the last meeting and 
various suggestions have been made already. On our tenth anniversary we 
celebrated at the Whitewebbs Museum, bringing in our own buffet. This could be 
repeated, although having caterers supply the food would be an alternative. Our 
venue for the Christmas meal, Pearse House could also be suitable. Other 
suggestions have been a drive to a suitable pub for a lunch, a trip along the 
River Lea on a dining cruise. A few of us recently had a day in York with a 
first class train trip which included full breakfast and four course dinner. 
This was very enjoyable but dates and destinations for next year are only just 
becoming available.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">In past Newsletters, both Alan and I 
have mentioned that there are a lot of regular members on our list who we never 
see. It is gratifying that you feel that the Newsletter keeps you in touch but 
on the occasion of our twentieth anniversary, it really would be nice to meet up 
with our not so familiar members.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">That view also applies to the 
Christmas Dinner on 3rd December. Everyone should now have a copy of the menu 
and we hope that more of you will give Barbara a ring to book. She will need a 
deposit of £5 a head and your choices from the menu. Alan assures us that the 
food is very good and plentiful.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">At the end of September, Doug and I 
joined up with the XK register for a weekend in Hampshire. We were staying at a 
conference centre near Haselmere and it was a much earlier breakfast than some 
people are used to on a Saturday morning before organiser Nick Peace’s briefing 
and our drive to Portsmouth. He had arranged for our cars to be parked in front 
of H.M.S. Victory. He had to provide names and car registrations beforehand for 
security reasons. He also had to provide us all with a large piece of cardboard 
to stop oil drips on quay area. However, on a fairly windy day these didn’t stay 
in position very well. We could have done with some of the Victory’s cannon 
balls to weigh them down. WE had day tickets to enjoy any of the numerous 
attractions on offer; the Victory, Mary Rose, Mary Rose Museum and the Warrior 
which was part of the transition between sail and steam. We also had a boat trip 
around the naval dockyard with an informative commentary. It would probably take 
two days to really see everything that there is available.</FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On Sunday morning in glorious 
sunshine we visited Bignor Roman Villa near Petworth. There are many fine 
examples of their mosaic floors including one almost complete corridor floor. 
The site is well away from main road along twisting country lanes. We opted to 
just follow two other cars who knew the right way. Unfortunately we lost sight 
of them around the bends and at a junction had to make our own 
decision.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I soon realised that we weren’t on 
the same roads as before, but by this time we had a procession of about six Xks 
and an E-type behind us! I’m used to Dick and Eric’s cars following us and 
accepting any of my navigation errors, but this number of cars was somewhat 
different. However, it all worked out OK and we arrived at our Sunday lunch 
destination. It was a very well organised weekend and the lovely weather was a 
real bonus.

<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I should have mentioned last month 
that the saga of Alan’s white shirt continued when Doug "won" it in a quiz while 
we were away at Tewkesbury. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">It is the time of the year for 
British Legion Memberships to be renewed, as regular visitors should all be 
members there. There may be an odd occasion when the main bar is in use due to a 
quiz night. If you arrive at any time and find that this is the case, we will be 
upstairs. 
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P align=justify>It has been suggested that maybe we could make the Christmas 
meal a fancy dress. We talked about it at the last meeting and some of the 
reaction was "I will if you will" but in general I think the opinion was that 
fancy dress would be better for a dinner/dance/disco rather than just a meal. 
All views are welcome, as they are about anything else to do with the 
club.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#000000><FONT

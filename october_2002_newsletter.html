<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">On the 29th September, quite a few 
of us were at the Whitewebbs Museum to welcome the SS Register. In June last 
year only two SS cars were there but this time, thanks to plenty of reminders in 
Jaguar Driver from Nik Drukker, there were five, including two lovely SS100s. 
Five may not seem many but Nik says that at big events, like National Day, there 
are never any more than about eighteen, so it wasn&#8217;t a bad turnout. Dave Norton 
was on hand again to give his usual entertaining and informative guide around 
the museum. Nik seemed just as impressed as on his first visit last year. An 
added bonus, apart from the lovely sunshine, was a French Market in one of the 
nearby garden centres. Several of us wandered round there returning with jam, 
cheese etc.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">As usual, the last event of the 
season was the Breakfast Run to Rickling Green. The Bullsmoor Lane group had a 
last minute addition. At the Museum the previous week, Dick Rogers and Eric 
Tetsell had met someone who had recently bought an immaculate XJS convertible. 
As he lived near our meeting point, he came over to look at the the cars and 
when Dick suggested he join us on the Run as there were a couple of spare 
places, he rushed home to get his wife out of bed!! We had a good run with the 
XKs of Dick, Doug, Richard and George taking over the lead at various times, so 
they could enjoy the sound of someone overtaking. It was only when we pulled in 
to a layby along the A120 that Roy told us our convoy had also been joined by a 
police car. As he never pulled out to stop anyone, we assume he enjoyed the cars 
as well. Tim Proctor and his team did their usual good job in providing us all 
with a nice breakfast. The addition of a couple of toasters and a loaf (or 
three!) enabled everyone to keep well supplied with toast. As normal, quite a 
few people went back to Alan and Barbara&#8217;s for yet more tea, coffee, cakes and 
biscuits.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">If you have ever wondered what 
happened to a car you once owned, or perhaps you wish to find out the history of 
a car now in your possession, you may be interested in a new web site, which 
seems to be the car owner&#8217;s version of Friendsreunited. The site address is <A

<P align=justify>It is in its infancy at the moment, but well worth a look.

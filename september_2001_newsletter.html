COUNTRY SHOW - Holly Hill Farm, Enfield - Monday 27th August 2001</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></B></U></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">The first joint event 
held by the well established Heavy Horse Show and the Whitewebb Museum&#8217;s Steam 
and Country Fair, previously held at Trent Park, seems to have been very 
successful. Unfortunately, for those attending this two day event on the Sunday, 
it was very wet and miserable. On Bank Holiday Monday however, it was just about 
perfect. The EDVVS had asked us to put on a club display and about fifteen of 
our cars made a good show. Thanks to Eric for organising the passes again and to 
John W. for mowing our area for us. We treated this as a mini Pageant, with our 
tent and cookers, so that Barbara and I could do the bacon rolls 
again.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">Dave Norton did his 
usual good job of commentating on all the cars as we went into the arena. The 
tractors and steam vehicles were also described by Dave, while a gentleman 
answering to the name of Jumbo did the honors for the Heavy Horse Association. 
To the uninitiated it was interesting to hear the difference between the various 
horses and their wagons, cars and harness etc. One highlight was an old Shand 
Mason fire engine pulled by two grey Percherons. They galloped around the arena 
before extinguishing a burning hay bale. Several other horses were being used to 
demonstrate the way old fashioned farm implements were pulled across the fields, 
in contrast to a massive John Deere tractor.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">The mix of cars, steam 
vehicles and horses worked well making an enjoyable, relaxing show which 
hopefully will become a regular event.

2nd September</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></B></U></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">As a club, we have 
been going to the MG and Police Show at Chigwell for many years and for a few 
weeks we expected last year&#8217;s show to be the last because of various changes in 
the Met and Essex Police areas. I think for only the second time, all the cars 
were at the Roding end of the show-ground, which does give the feeling of not 
quite being part of the rest of the show. Mick and Jacquie had arrived first and 
managed to secure an area for us but we were not able to spread ourselves too 
much. I think the general opinion is that this show is not what it was. As we 
were not given arena programmes this year I don&#8217;t know what events were 
scheduled, but it did not seem as though the normal motor bike competition and 
horse and dog displays were put on the by the police. There was a dog handling 
demonstration by a dog club and a different motor bike display team. Frank Bruno 
made an appearance to sign autographs. The highlight of this show for the past 
few years seems to have become Area 57&#8217;s invasion of the dodgems; about ten cars 
this year for three turns. At the time of writing, about ten days later, I still 
have the bruises to prove that a good time was had by all.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">For a few years now, 
someone from the M.G. club has chosen one of our cars as best Jaguar, and we 
were pleased to get a little shield when our XK was picked. However, Phil and 
Heather went one better as their MK VII was chosen as Classic Car of the Show 
and they have a silver salver for a year.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify></B></U></P>
<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS"><FONT color=#0000ff>On September 1st and 2nd, the 
Chigwell Police Club staged its annual summer fayre. This event is always an 
enjoyable public relations exercise. I was, however, disappointed with the fact 
that Essex Police did not participate, not even by providing a constable to 
assist with vehicle access to the club from the High Road. Instead, Essex Police 
staged their own version of PR, that of Positive Revenue, by operating a speed 
trap in a lay-by between the top of Chigwell High Road and Rolls Park Corner on 
Sunday evening. It is quite apparent that Essex Police do not realise that the 
public are aware of the financial gains being exploited by Essex Police to the 
detriment of other services. The constabulary overtime analysis would make 
interesting reading. Speed traps are extremely useful near schools and accident 
blackspots as a deterrent but not as a license to print money.

WEEKEND</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></B></U></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">Over the 7th-9th 
September, fourteen of us spent the weekend at the Springfield Hotel near 
Wareham in Dorset; a return visit for some of us. When Eric and Margot, Dick and 
Eileen and ourselves arrived about 3 p.m, we found Len and Sally, Keith and 
Audrey and Tom and Enid already sitting in the garden with several bottles of 
wine on the table. A little later, the group was completed by the arrival of 
Phil and Heather. The hotel has both indoor and outdoor swimming pools but the 
weather was so kind to us that it was the outside one which was used. Three full 
sized snooker tables were among the other facilities at the hotel and Eileen was 
the champion at potting the cue ball! </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">Saturday morning 
started with drizzle but it all cleared by about 10.30 a.m and it was decided to 
take a trip on a preserved railway (full-size) which ran between a village near 
Corfe Castle and Swanage. I might do the hotel bookings but I take no credit for 
the fortuitous way in which things worked out that day. It turned out to be a 
special steam weekend with extra engines in steam hauling both passenger and 
goods wagons all day, including some working as double headers. At a station 
half way along the line, there was a small classic car show, so we all got off 
there for a look round. I know there is probably some prejudice but the best car 
was a red MK II Jaguar. Back on the train for Swanage and while looking out to 
sea in glorious sunshine, we saw lots of people wandering around in various 
costumes, Morris Dancers etc. We headed back towards the station only to find we 
had just met the beginning of a parade of all the various groups, dancing, 
playing instruments etc.; all very colourful. It turned out to be an annual folk 
festival with groups from all over the county.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">On Sunday morning, 
Eric and Margot left after breakfast as they were driving to Dover for a few 
days in France. The rest of us drove to the local beauty spot of Lulworth Cave 
where ten of us had a boat ride along the coast to Dundle Door and back. After 
that, Tom and Enid and Keith and Audrey headed home while the rest of us visited 
Monkey World, an ape rescue centre, a few miles away. Apparently they have been 
housing all sorts of monkeys, chimps, orangutans, lemurs etc. for about fifteen 
years. Most of them have been rescued from the illegal pet trade or from 
laboratories. The conditions for them are excellent.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">For the last few 
years, we have spent the evenings on various quizzes that some of us have 
organised and it makes an enjoyable after dinner pastime. With a lot of help 
from the weather it had been another very enjoyable weekend.

</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">Just a very brief 
mention of other events that people have attended recently. Apparently, National 
Day at Gaydon was very wet according to Chris Engeham, as was Area 33&#8217;s day at 
Audley End where it appears that the entry system could have been better. 
</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff face="Comic Sans MS">According to Alan 
Collins, the show at St Mary's School, Bishops Stortford is growing, but those 
members who attended felt they needed some practise at putting up the club 
banner and flags, I gather.

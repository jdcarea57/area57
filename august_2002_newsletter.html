<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>As I write this, the forecast 
for the August Bank Holiday looks promising, so hopefully the Holly Hill Show 
should be as enjoyable as last year. When I write next month&#8217;s Newsletter, I 
will no doubt be able to give the general opinion of the M.G/Police Show at 
Chigwell. It seems that most people think this show is not what it was, and last 
years positioning of the cars did nothing to dispel this view.
<HR>
</FONT>
<P></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A couple of things that there 
is time to remind you of are the show at St Mary&#8217;s School, Bishops Stortford on 
22nd September and the Jaguar/Open Day at Whitewebbs Museum a week later. The SS 
Register has been invited and Nick Drukker is hopeful of getting more of his 
members along this time. Museum members cars will also be there so hopefully 
there will be a good turnout.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>At the end of July, Richard 
and Eileen Rogers and ourselves headed off to North Wales again. On our journey 
there, it seemed as though we were seeing more sports cars than usual; mainly 
M.Gs and Triumphs but plenty of friendly acknowledgments along the way. The day 
after we arrived we drove down to Bala for a few supplies. When we returned to 
the car park we found a Daimler Dart, an M.G.B. and a fifties Ford (can&#8217;t 
remember the model). Looking at their tax discs, they were from the Swansea 
area. Their owners returned a few minutes later and we all had a friendly chat. 
They were staying near Tall-y-llyn lake and having a touring weekend. On our 
homeward journey we kept meeting Riley R.Ms (ten in all) so they must have been 
having a get together somewhere in the area. Every year, we comment on the good 
condition of the Welsh roads making it an ideal area for old cars.

<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Quite a few of us attended 
this new event on the calendar on August 11th. First impressions were good as 
there were plenty of very visible signs along the route and we were met by one 
of the organisers who asked a youngster on a bike to show us to our plot. That&#8217;s 
when the organisation went pear shaped. Every area he took us to had one car on 
it, holding it for a particular group. Eventually we found an area that we could 
claim as our own; not spacious but we had room for our banner. After that, it 
turned out to be a very enjoyable show.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>A two day event, it was the 
first time this show had been held and it attracted a wide variety of cars of 
many vintages and makes. Arena events were taking place all afternoon; country 
dancing, driving skills, tug-o&#8217;-war and strongest man, just to mention a few. I 
think the commentator who announced the various events could have got a job as 
the speaking clock in his spare time as we kept hearing that something was due 
to start in exactly three minutes or other very precise timings. Hot and cold 
refreshments were available and there were a couple of craft tents.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>In addition, Carters Steam 
Fair was on site, a very traditional fair with steam powered Gallopers and, I 
think I am correct in saying, the only steam yachts still in existence. Needless 
to say there was a visit to the dodgems by a large Area 57 contingent, which was 
thoroughly enjoyed by all concerned.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>This could become a regular 
event on our calendar as the general impression was quite favourable.

Wednesday 10th July</FONT></P>

Tetsell</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></I>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify></B>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I always look forward to the 
Harpenden Show so the weather forecast was of particular interest, as it was not 
good. Anyway, I still attended because in England if you wait for good weather 
you could wait forever and this show is by far the best evening show I have ever 
attended.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>On arrival at 5.30 p.m. the 
heavens opened up with a vengeance so John and I decided to open the wine early. 
This was a big mistake because Keith and Audrey can smell alcohol from Hertford, 
and their arrival seemed to be more than just a coincidence!</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Again, I was astonished at 
the quality and quantity of cars in attendance, even with the bad weather, 
although this passed over quite quickly and had by now turned into an excellent 
evening. The numbers must have been well over a thousand, quite astonishing for 
an evening show.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>Some of the cars I found 
particularly interesting were a Turner open two-seater sports car (something I 
had never seen before), a Humber Sceptre diesel, yes diesel.! Two absolutely 
stunning Triumph Gloria&#8217;s mid 1930&#8217;s, one belonging to Doug Shipman&#8217;s nephew. A 
Riley Kestrel with the most delicate grill I have ever seen on a sports car, the 
list is endless. Some cars had even come up from Devon to attend. Most people 
bring a picnic or a barbeque with them but this year was rather spoilt by the 
conditions underfoot.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>I have been trying to analyse 
what makes this show so special as it has very little organisation in evidence. 
Maybe North Hertfordshire has more than its fair share of classics, or maybe 
they just use them more than the average classic owner. The use of a common is a 
bonus as it does not incur any charges therefore all the money raised goes to 
local good causes. This show is not even advertised, and local residents are 
mainly oblivious to its existence, yet on average it attracts 1,200 vehicles, 
that&#8217;s about one third of Enfield Pageant&#8217;s attendance. I think it is quite 
remarkable. Come along next year and see for yourself.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>When we arrived at Great 
Saling we were each given a wristband to wear, so they knew we had paid. After 
the cars were parked, I had a bacon sarnie with Grandad and the rest of Area 
57.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>My first stop was the 
Homemade Fudge and Sweet Stall (Yummy!). I had my hair braided and made a bead 
bracelet in the Craft Tent. I also made a candle, twice, on the honey stall 
(Beekeeping).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>My Grandad took me to the 
Steam Fair, Carters I think it was called. We went on the Steam Boat, the 
scariest ride in the world...it was frightening trying to keep in my seat. I 
also went on the old fashioned Gallopers and Octopus, all with Grandad. There 
were lots and lots of old cars to look at, I looked at some.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>We took a picnic, but you

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>The past few Sundays have 
enjoyed pretty good weather, and the morning of the first Breakfast Run to the 
Cricketers at Rickling Green was no exception. This very popular event seems to 
have attracted record numbers this year, and the convoy of Jaguars leaving 
Bullsmoor Lane in Enfield at 8 o&#8217;clock was longer than it has been for some 
time. We arrived at the pub shortly before the other group, who had started from 
the Royal Forest Hotel in Chingford, and after fifteen minutes or so chatting in 
the morning sunshine we all went in for the usual hearty full English breakfast, 
provided by the staff at the Cricketers with their usual efficiency.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>After we had eaten our fill, 
several of us went back to Alan &amp; Barbara&#8217;s house for tea, coffee, and cake, 
and the day remained so pleasant that Alan decided at around 1 p.m. that it 
would be a good idea to get some suitable food in and light up the barbecue. 
Many thanks Alan &amp; Barbara for what turned out to be a whole day out. (For 
those of you who nipped off earlier, you missed an excellent afternoon).

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Our next club meeting is on 
Bank Holiday Monday, 6th May, the same day as the charity show at Stanborough 
Lakes, Welwyn Garden City. As usual we will meet up in the car park of the 
Gosling Sports Stadium first, where Barbara will collect £5 per car. I imagine 
that everybody knows how to get there by now but if anyone needs directions, 
just give me a ring. Also, if anyone wants to meet at our house at 9.30, please 
let me know.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Although the Pageant is a 
week later this year to coincide with the Jubilee Bank Holiday, the weeks are 
flying by. Please contact Eric Tetsell as soon as possible if you can show your 
car on Sunday 2nd June and/or Monday 3rd. Don&#8217;t forget that although we only put 
on a club display on those two days, it is open on Saturday so anybody wanting 
to go over there can put their car there on our plot.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>I imagine that the May 
Newsletter will be with you before the Pageant but just in case it&#8217;s not, I&#8217;ll 
do some reminders now. First and foremost please be on site by 9 a.m. The 
membership list which you all have, lists plenty of mobile numbers so it you are 
held up, let somebody know! Everyone knows by now, what to bring in the way of 
water, cookers, tables etc. so I&#8217;ll just remind everyone to bring a mug. Of 
course the day will start with our usual bacon rolls.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>By the way, if anyone needs a 
new T-shirt, sweater etc. before then, please let me know.

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>You may remember that last 
June, Dick Rogers made arrangements with Nick Drukker for the SS Register to 
visit Whitewebbs Museum. Despite a beautiful day, only Nick and one other SS 
turned up (apart from Dick&#8217;s own car). Many Museum cars went to another event 
and it also clashed with a charity event at Chigwell that some of our members 
attended. Nick was very impressed with the Museum and wrote an article to that 
effect in the Jaguar Driver a few months ago. He hopes that by giving his 
Register members more warning, they can do better this year and he has already 
mentioned in the Jaguar Driver, a repeat visit to the Museum on 29th Sept. which 
he has arranged with Dick.

you are interested, speak to Brian at a meeting, or phone him.

Wight Ramble - April 2002</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Report by Audrey 
Williams</FONT></P></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Friday 5th April was a 
beautiful warm Spring day. We reached our hotel in plenty of time to explore Old 
Shanklin Village and sit outside for a cream tea. Whitewebbs made us very 
welcome and so Friday evening was quite a jolly affair, partly due to the 
concessions on House wine and the marvelous magician who entertained us during 
dinner.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Saturday 6th April was a 
beautiful cold, Spring day. We all parked at Havenstreet for the day to go on 
the Steam Railway. The journey to Smallbrook was wonderful with rampant wild 
flowers on both sides of the banks. The journey to Ryde was not so wonderful.. 
It became cold and windy and our main problem was finding a decent pub for lunch 
We found shelter in the King Lud only to find several other ramblers had had the 
same idea. Ryde was disappointing - all tacky souvenir shops and charity shops!! 
When we got back to Havenstreet there was a classic double decker bus waiting 
for us. It took us through leafy lanes to Newpark where we visited the Classic 
Boat Museum and the Bus Museum. Entertainment at dinner was noisy!! Our table 
was next to the music and so we all had to shout to make ourselves heard! The 
raffle made up for this, Stan really excelled himself - not an old can of WD40 
or a packet of biscuits in sight!! He collected £200 which will be handed over 
to the Cancer fund at Stanborough Lakes on the Bank Holiday Monday. </FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Sunday morning was planned 
for us as a trip to the Pearl factory on the coast road back to the ferry at 
Yarmouth. All the ladies were given a free gift (some pretty earrings and a not 
so pretty brooch). I half thought of giving mine to Stan for the next raffle but 
changed by mind when I saw some ladies wearing their brooches at lunchtime!! I 
didn&#8217;t want to offend anyone as it was our first trip with the museum. ( I&#8217;ll 
wait until next year).</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>All 98 of us stopped off at 
Lymington for lunch at Towles Restaurant. It&#8217;s not far from Beaulieu , so if you 
are ever in that area - it&#8217;s a must. The Sweets in particular were amazing with 
over 15 to choose from.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>All in all it was a super 
weekend and excellent value for money - most of the trips and meals were 
included in the price. We hope to go on the Ramble again next year and may take 
advantage of the extra day - got to be worth the extra £35!!</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>ACADEMIC WORKS INSIDE JAGUAR 
TEAM ON SAFETY PROJECT</FONT></P></B></U><B><I></B></I>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Privileged purchases of the 
latest model from Jaguar will benefit from University of Hertfordshire 
expertise. Academic William Tiu worked on the X400 safety technology during a 
sabbatical period with the manufacturer at Coventry. As part of the company&#8217;s 
Engineering Research Centre Group. Dr. Tiu, a senior lecturer in the faculty of 
Engineering and Information Sciences, worked side-by-side with specialist 
studying safety aspects of occupants in the event of a crash.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>"I was a member of a 
six-strong team," said Dr. Tiu. "The excellent thing about this kind of 
sabbatical is that both parties - the university and Jaguar - gain from the 
association. It was certainly very good experience for me and I have gained 
tremendous insight through the work."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=3>Much of the project entailed 
computer-aided simulation of factors involved in accident scenarios in which the 
£30,000 V6 3 litre vehicle might be engaged. He underlined the daunting speed 
wiith which an impact happens once contact is made with another object. "The 
duration is just one tenth of a second." Much of his activity at Jaguar was the 
examination of how the lower part of the anatomy is affected during that brief 
shock, looking at the way the lower abdomen and the legs interact with the floor 
pan. "We modelled the way that the deformation of the pan affects the feet and 
the legs", he added. "Frequently the accident victim experiences 
life-threatening loss of blood from the vessels in the lower anatomy and the 
legs having survived the crash."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify></P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>In the past four years, he said, the European 
Crash Regulatory Body had been paying much more attention to effects of impacts 
upon the lower part of the body. "One could say that with air bag technology so 
well advanced, the top of the body has been dealt with, which leaves the matter 
of the bottom half."
